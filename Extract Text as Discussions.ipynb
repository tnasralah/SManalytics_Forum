      "For those of you who are now using the latest G5 update you have noticed some nice improvements.  However the decision to override the Mute and Do Not Disturb functions of the iPhone is very worrisome.  They have essentially taken something away from us instead of given us something useful.Now we are awoken on many nights for every single alert and alarm on our G5.  Do I need to be awoken at 3am to calibrate? Is that an emergency?  Or at 4am that my sensor is going to expire?  Really?Dexcom can you give us on option to turn this new 'feature' OFF.  I was very happy the way it was before.  And for those who like this feature they can turn it ON.The Do Not Disturb function is a VERY powerful feature of the iPhone and Dexcom has taken that away from us without our consent.Please fix this is and give us our options back.. My biggest problem is that the alarm is VERY loud. I understand the point but we should have an option.I was at the airport yesterday and the phone was in my pocket beeping like crazy despite the fact that I had the watch connected to it.. For better or worse I suspect the FDA had a hand in this. I'm probably one of the few who is happy about this as my daughter can no longer blow off her alerts with Do Not Disturb. She of course is none too pleased.... The alarm for the session is about to expire in 1 hour sounds like a 5 Alarm fire.  Really Dexcom?  What a cruel reminder that we are diabetic.We lived a whole year without this feature with the G5 I think we can manage going forward.  Give us a choice.. I agree with you @Anthony. The larger issue here is Dexcom's decision to shut down your choice. I do think the 55 alarm should attract our attention however.. I would be ok with the 55 alarm. But to bypass mute for ALL of the alarms is such a disservice to us diabetics.  Dexcom please fix this.. Glad I'm lazy about updating my apps. Looks like current v. is 1.5.1 and I'm still on v. 1.2.4. I may keep holding off. They do tout that you can select vibrate-only for the alarm now which may help a little. But I agree this Do Not Disturb feature should be an option not a hardwired default.. I know this is likely an exceedingly remote option but should mention it just in case it could work for someone...If you're willing to switch to an Android phone you can ditch Dexcom's app altogether and use the hacker community open-source app xdrip (or its variation xdrip+).The various alarms and notifications are much much more configurable allowing for everything you all would like and a lot more (like for example custom ringtones for each alarm type).Not to mention a ton of other incredible features not available in Dexcom's app direct reading collection from an Android Wear smartwatch (no phone needs to be present) and a very responsive development group.If you're smartphone agnostic I'd highly recommend the switch. The downside is of course there's no warranty guarantees if a bug gives you totally inaccurate readings you're own your own etc. etc. etc.. The Vibrate option is very misleading and perhaps malfunctioning. Even alarms set to vibrate will sound a loud alarm if you do not dismiss them on the phone. The sensor expiration alarm is a loud audible alarm regardless of your settings. Also if you dismiss an alarm on your watch it has no effect. You have to dismiss it from your phone. Otherwise it repeats every five minutes. This really sucks.. The alarm is SO LOUD now regardless of vol setting on phone; it's awful. I now have to turn my alerts to vibrate manually if I'm in a meeting seminar doing clinical work or even at a coffee shop working on my laptop because it's so disruptive. It's also annoying to have to switch each alarm on/off separately and to have to locate the right alert to switch back to each time. Ugh. Awful.. My conspiracy theory is that the FDA person hates diabetics. Everything that I see is consistent with this theory.. Because Dexcom had a few receivers that malfunctioned and did not alarm now we are all paying the price with these rediculously loud alarms on our iPhones.   They really need some type 1s to test these releases.  This is a terrible update.. I was an early complainer to Dexcom over this G5 app update. After several calls to guys I know there they finally admitted they \"messed up and were working on a new update to correct the issue.\" Of course I lost enough sleep now that I have removed the G5 app from my phone and gone back to the Medtronic Enlite in the meantime. Such careless untested updates should never be allowed to leave and rolling back the change should have been easy with an update following immediately. For me it is a bad mark on Dexcom.As to other \"nice features\" - they still haven't addressed the most asked for ones like event data and scrolling in portrait mode. And the watch update defaulting to 1 hour is not to my liking - especially since they do not save the last selected period they cheapened the look of the Apple Watch display and the crown twist to change the period is \"iffy\" at best.If they didn't make such a darned good CGM sensor I would have eliminated them from my life at this point.. The power switch is a very powerful option on an iPhone too;). Being safe and keeping one's mental health while managing diabetes is definitely a tightrope walk. When things get too intrusive we quit using them. I hated the previous sound profiles of the G5 but got used to keeping my phone on mute. The idea that muting my phone isn't enough to protect me from those horrendous alarms is enough to make me quit using Dexcom. I'll soon be on Medicare with no CGM coverage and I have been wondering what it would be like to go back to no CGM. (It's been 8 years for me.)I am currently using an unused G4 transmitter that I had from my free upgrade to G5. It is annoying to carry the receiver but I am starting to wish that the unused G5 transmitters on my shelf were G4.. I reverted to the G4 Share system due to longer transmitter life and range as well as an easier to look at screen during sleep time. I don't value the phone app as much as many here so I know it's easier for me to go back to the G4. It is an option -- Dexcom still sells the G4 Share.. The power switch is a very powerful option on an iPhone too;)I totally agree. I now power off during the first night after sensor change. Typically only useless wrong alarms in the first 24 hours.. @kmichel I forgot that they changed the watch to one hour instead of the usual 3 hour. These changes are just careless. Also even if you are wearing the watch if an alert is triggered the phone still vibrates.  And if it's laying on a countertop it's loud. Great point here. Btw we are not the only ones who are angry. Look up the reviews in the App Store and ppl are saying the same thing.. Can you explain briefly the main differences between G4 share and G5?  Is it that with the G5 you don't need to use the receiver at all?  I know it's been explained to me before but I forget.  This conversation is reminding me of all the reasons I didn't like cgm when I used it in past.  Am now approved for the G5 at negligible cost-- I just have to call and ask them to ship it... but still not convinced I really want it... leaning towards no at this point still.

Can you explain briefly the main differences between G4 share and G5?The G4 Share sends an RF signal to the G4 receiver. From there it is relayed to an iPhone resident app called Share2 via bluetooth low energy signal. You may not operate the iPhone app without the receiver. The iPhone app can also relay a bluetooth signal to a smartwatch. I use the Apple Watch but I also have a Pebble smartwatch to see a BG display. The G4 transmitter is warrantied for 6 months and some people report more than 1 year's service life. The two I've drained have last 9-10 months for me. The G4 receiver display as white pixels on black background.The G5 system sends a signal from the transmitter to a receiver and/or an iPhone. In essence you have two separate receivers. The G5 transmitter is hard-wired to expire in 90 + 22 days maximum. In the US Dexcom sold 2 G5 transmitter for the same price as 1 G4 transmitter. The G5 receiver displays mostly white background contrasted with turned off (black) pixels.  Many users report reduced range with the G5 vs. G4. Some people report more missed data points with the G5 vs. G4. Some users report little to no data loss with their G5 systems.. I would be ok with the 55 alarm. But to bypass mute for ALL of the alarms is such a disservice to us diabetics.  Dexcom please fix this.With the new update we have been able to turn off the audible alarms for everything except for the urgent low. Are you finding something different? It sounds like you are not able to turn off the audible for any of the alerts. Am I misunderstanding?. You can't easily mute all of the alarms which is actually a significant problem for usability. I have to go in manually and turn each low/high alert to vibrate and then back to the low/high alert when I want to silence my phone which is pretty often for short periods of time (meetings etc). Not being able to use the silence switch or DND function is disruptive and increases the odds I'll forget to turn the Dex alerts back on and then miss them (which has already happened to me).. With the new update we have been able to turn off the audible alarms for everything except for the urgent low. Are you finding something different? It sounds like you are not able to turn off the audible for any of the alerts. Am I misunderstanding?Hi @Lorraine.  On Sunday early morning the sensor about to expire alarm came on and that is LOUD both vibrating and fire alarm bells.  This bypasses the Do Not Disturb.The other night at 3am my phone vibrated and beeped b/c it need a calibration again bypassing the Do Not Disturb of my iPhone.Also even when you have the HIGH and LOW alarms set to vibrate the phone still vibrates when you have the watch on.  Why did they change this?  Vibrate is just as loud when the phone sits on your desk.. At least you guys have a phone app.    As a droid user I'm still waiting for anything at all.. On Sunday early morning the sensor about to expire alarm came on and that is LOUD both vibrating and fire alarm bells.  This bypasses the Do Not Disturb.The other night at 3am my phone vibrated and beeped b/c it need a calibration again bypassing the Do Not Disturb of my iPhone.Oh. We haven't experienced this yet. I'm glad to be on the alert. This sounds like no fun at all. . Personally to avoid this update I shut off my automatic updates when I started hearing about it. Luckily it hadn't updated it yet. So I just go in and update other ones and leave that one be.. I personally haven't had an issue with the new update yet. I do wish they would allow customizable sound alerts(like ringtones). I actually like the fact the 'do not disturb' switch will be overruled if there is an alarm being 'ignored' overnight. I am a very light sleeper and don't want to hear text message alerts or any other unimportant things overnight. I HAVE missed low alarms because of this (one time drifting in the 40's for several hours). So to me I feel much more safe going to sleep at night knowing no matter what I will get the important audible while still ignoring the random group text messages family and friends decide to do at 11 pm (I get up at 3:45 AM every morning...so I don't want that LOL). There is a fairly easy solution. Go to Settings > Alarms and for each alarm set it to Vibrate Only. Now the only alarm that makes noise is the Urgent Low.. Still not great if you want to be able to quickly shut them on and off oftenas someone who has to go in and out of meetings and such but otherwise wants them on that's kind of key.. Apparently after speaking with a Dexcom Tech all this has come about because of the FDA! They have decided that there should only be ONE device that you are allowed to control at a time. I found this out because I was complaining that since the update I couldn't acknowledge the alerts on my watch but had to always unlock my iPhone and acknowledge them there--which was a real pain if my phone was in my purse or on the charger. This kind of defeats my having bought the Apple Watch--and since I'm on Medicare I am paying out of pocket. Before the update I could acknowledge the alert on my watch easily.. all this has come about because of the FDA! They have decided that there should only be ONE device that you are allowed to control at a time.So.... basically the FDA is saying if you want a device to work the way the user wants in a way that is tailored to the user's requirements for the medial device you need to use open source software like xDrip+. I can't see how this is making people any safer.I use a pebble watch and find that the vibrate on the watch is pretty awesome as far as alerts go. Much better than noise or a vibrating phone in my pocket and it actually wakes me up at night. Plus I can dismiss the alarm from the watch.. Yes that's nice AE13 but I use an iPhone and an Apple Watch so I think I'm out of luck...... Very interesting... I just read on the Dexcom Forum on Facebook that indeed Dexcom is telling patients (as they told me) that it was the FDA who mandated the unfortunate changes to their software however that is NOT true!!! Everyone on that forum was complaining about the software update too and somebody actually called the FDA and was told that Dexcom had total control of the software!. Anyone else get a user satisfaction survey from Dexcom about the update? I'm guessing they are sending it out in response to the complaints.... My favorite is the calibration alarm. Because whether or not I enter my first two values is life and death... and I honestly don't even want the urgent alarm going off during the day. Night maybe day no thanks. Always great when a diabetes device interrupts meetings and interviews. That's one of the reasons I no longer want a cgm integrated into my pump because it would not shut up.. Stop waiting today and use xdrip.. I didn't update after reading about the alarm issue. I just got a very detailed survey from Dexcom about the G5 so It seems they are rethinking the alarm situation.. If you have your phone backed up to a computer it is possible to delete the current 1.5.1 app and load the older version back on your phone. I did this with a back-up in iTunes. This allow for the alarm option again.. The good news about the new update is that there is an automatic synching with the Clarity app (you may have to delete and download again) so that the username and password is read from the G5 app and a code can be generated. This was a huge issue in clinic.. Unfortunately I only back up to the Cloud. Dexcom already did suggest that to me.. The bit about the FDA is not true. They don't get FDA approval for their app because their iPhone app and interface is not FAD approved. That is why the FDA requires them to ship you a physical receiver with the G5. They cannot maintain a reliable connection with the phone so the FDA won't approve nor control their device.They admitted to me that they messed it up. And I don't know about the rest of you but setting the Alert settings to Vibrate does not stop the audible alerts for me. I still get full volume (regardless of my volume settings) alerts for everything. I have too much experience with iOS apps and know some of the Dexcom engineers who work/worked on the G5 app to know better. One of the guys who wrote the original G5 app works for me.. If what @kmichel says is true it's ridiculous this has gone on almost a week without a fix released. It's a simple thing to change in the code and I feel confident saying that without having seen the code at all.. Dexcom first rolled out this awful change on November 1 @Dave26. That's 20 days of different stories to different people. As a firmware manager at a medical device company I wouldn't stand for this from my team.. I just noticed that if I put my iphone on silent the notifications from dexcom will not be forwarded to my phone. Actually the visual ones will but not the sound/vibration. I can hear the phone vibrate but the watch is dead silent. Strange.. Yes this is also happening to me.  This release is really bad and I hope they fix it soon.  Whats the point of the watch if it doesn't even notify you when it should?  The last version worked so well why did they change it.Dexcom please fix this.. Just spoke to the guys at Dexcom. They are working diligently on a fix and hope to have a new version out \"soon.\" I couldn't get a more firm commitment from them on this. It was kind of amazing that I had to tell one of their guys how to roll back a version to prevent the problem on his device . What's the easiest way for us to roll back to the old version on the iPhone?. The easiest way is if you have an iCloud backup. If you do and it is from October 31 or before you go into Settings General and Reset. You then restore your device from your old iCloud backup. But it is a one time thing. Once you do this your old backups will disappear forever. You can also do the restore from a backup that has been saved on your computer. Those backups stay which gives you a chance to save backups long term. This is why I always recommend backup up to your computer on a regular basis.The downside of doing this as fair warning is that if you restore to the previous version of the App and you use the Apple Watch you also get the previous version of the Apple Watch. That is OK as long as you do NOT subsequently update your phone to iOS 10.1.2 or later which uses a new update interface. If you do update to the new iOS your watch will no longer update the glucose readings on a regular basis.. ust spoke to the guys at Dexcom.Thank you for the update @kmichel.  Much appreciated.  I just hope they fix all the issues I found - I found several in the latest update not just one.. As a side note: Do not update to iOS 10.2 or Watch OS 3.1.1 at the moment. Though the new phone app will run on iOS 10.2 the new Watch App will not load with this combination. It will spin for a few seconds and drop out to the watch face. The previous phone and watch app will run but the watch app will not update. Dexcom has been notified.. What a giant CF (if you know what it means you're salty enough not to be offended ). If you don't have an iPhone 7 the easiest way to mute all alarms is to out in a headphone set. I have a set from the dollar store that is just the jack headphones cut off that I use. Mutes everything when I want it to. With a 7 not a clue as it doesn't have a headphone jack hole apparently..

Yes but that's we always have the real stuff first and you have to fiddle around with xDrip . Yes but that's we always have the real stuff first and you have to fiddle around with xDrip Touche! However at least I CAN mess around with xdrip... if this same situation occurred I'd just fix it build and put it on my phone. The problem would have been solved within 24-48 hours All kidding aside one interesting thing I'm finding with xdrip is it seems to be more accurate tham Dexcom's vaunted 505 firmware and requires less calibration to stay accurate. How can that be?I mean the developers working on various pieces and parts of the We're Not Waiting movement are simply hacks like me -- not PhD physiologists with major degrees in biochemistry or something.Yet I get better results with xdrip (i.e. more consistent with my Freestyle meter) than I do with the Dexcom receiver. Further I only calibrate once a day now as that's consistently been more than good enough for the several weeks I've been using it. So while we wait for the next generation and the awesome ability to only calibrate every 24 hours seems the technology is already there with the G5 at least for me with the right software interpreting the data from the sensor.IMO if Dexcom had a modicum of business intelligence they'd be on the developers of xdrip like white on rice hiring them outright or getting into some sort of formal contract arrangement to bring the technology into their product.Too often pride gets in the way of innovation. Truly smart companies don't let this sort of thing get in the way.While Dexcom seems to be ignoring this effort (as far as I can tell) Apple was very smart and hired the creator of Loop (one of the open-source APS projects).. Wow that's so simple and smart! Pretty sure I have some old/barely functioning headphones around somewhere I can sacrifice to the cause.. I fully agree. xDrip also gives an opportunity to continue to use the transmitter even after the official expiry on the G5-app(?). Dexcom definitely needs more developers on site since the updates are too slow the European versions of the app have no Apple Watch extension or Clarity service and of course there is no Android solution offered at all. In other words you are closing the door for half of your potential clients or you are at lease causing them a big expense for no reason at all.It would be great if Loop would be converted into an Android version as well that would be a real gamechanger.. DaveI've followed your writing on these forums.  Thank you for the descriptive writing.  I've been a user of G4 and G5 and have fantasized(sorry for the strange description) about having my CGM data on a wrist watch.  In addition I'd prefer to gather the collected data and be able to transfer that data to a program I write for further analysis staying out of the proprietary Dexcom cloud.I prefer the open ecosystem of Android.Based on your previous writings I understand all might be possible with the following setup;     G4 transmitter --> xDrip|xDrip+ (running on droid ware watch).If the aforementioned is correct regardless of cost please recommend a droid ware watch(s) and the OS ver. requirement for xDrip|xDrip+.I'd prefer to collect the data landing on the watch.  Is the transferred data text (CSV)?Can I move the data off the watch to another environment (workstation tablet etc)?Thank you.In good healthJasone. Could I cut my headphones that came with the iPhone and put that small piece at the base into the lightning port to mute all alarms from Dexcom?. Jasone what you want to do is 100% supported already by xdrip+. Data can be exported as CSV; data collected on the watch is synced to the phone when in BT range. Any access to the data (other than graphical display) is done through the phone.The one caveat is that you would be using \"wild\" software developed during people's spare time out of interest without the technical expertise the developers of the actual sensor technology at Dexcom have. So there are bugs from time to time and there may be reason for less \"faith\" in the accuracy/reliability of the software.Okay with standard disclaimer here's my real-world experience: The only bugs I've encountered have been my own introduced in the last week or so since I started messing with the app myself. These are in my private local development copy so anything you'd get from the \"official\" releases wouldn't have these issues. Also big plus is that any bugs you find will get interactive attention and depending on the severity fixed quickly.The app has been for me so far more accurate than the Dexcom receiver. Better than the vaunted new 505 firmware that came out a year or so ago. I can get away with calibrating less often than I did with the receiver.As for the rich functionality the only way to get a feel for that is to use the app.Recommendations: First you really want to go with a G5 system as the phone and watch can talk directly to transmitter. You can leave the receiver at home as a backup. You can do it with a G4 but you then have to build a small bridge device that has to be carried around too which nixes the benefit of shedding a device.As for watch people seem to be having good results with the Sony Smartwatch. I have a Huawei which doesn't work with the system no one knows why. I plan to debug it but I'm working on a different project right now adding another android App Widget to the application for use with the Wearable Widgets app and Samsung Gear smartwatches (I have an S2). Here's what it looks like at the moment:Again however I'm the only person that has this and I would recommend an Android Wear watch over the Gear S2 for xdrip+ if that is your primary reason for the smartwatch. When your ready to get going drop me a message and I'll help!. Dexcom definitely needs more developers on site since the updates are too slow the European versions of the app have no Apple Watch extension or Clarity service and of course there is no Android solution offered at all. In other words you are closing the door for half of your potential clients or you are at lease causing them a big expense for no reason at all.I doubt the impact in lost sales due to lack of an Android app is significant (perhaps not even measurable) given the core value proposition of their product.And this is likely the reason the pitiful software development investment you cite above persists.. DaveRegarding the \"open source\" software of xDrip...........I've lived a life of breaking/fixing different builds I have no concern.  Although appreciate your forthrightness.  I will have the receiver in a pocket somewhere not to mention my glucometer close by.  It would just be more practical to take a look at my wrist every once in a while vs. pulling out a device from my pocket.You mentioned phone in the hardware schema.  Ideally I want to use only G.X --> watch(sans the phone).Is that only doable via G4?  G5?  Both? Is the SmartWatch 3 SWR50 supported?Any GPS NON-Apple watches supported?In good healthJasone. The functionality on the watch itself is very limited. Basically all the Android Wear component of the system can do is collect readings from the sensor and display them. There is no way to access the readings from the watch directly via a PC or some other connection.The phone is the \"hub\" of the application so most of the functionality is there. The system can be configured to do all collection via the watch regardless of whether or not the phone is in range and connected to the watch. Data is synced continuously. However when away from the phone access to the collected data on the watch requires reconnecting with the phone so they can sync.Data is exported from the phone application.Both G4 and G5 are supported; however the G4 requires additional homebrew hardware to bridge the G4 transmitter and Android phone/watch.As far as support for various watches since this is ad-hoc community driven there is no source for what is and is not supported. I'd suggest joining the gitter channel and asking there -- probably someone with the watch that can speak up.. Thank you very much @LaBellaFarms and @Dave26 much appreciated for all the great insight and information.I do agree with the desire for a simple G.X --> watch solution; I can't imagine this is computationally limited it's all about getting in to the watch so it can do your specific job.  Someday soon I'd expect....

Someday soon I'd expect...Really the issue is not performance its interfacing.Smartwatches are designed to be tethered to a phone. As such without one there aren't really any easy ways to transfer data. Part of this is the limitation of how Android Wear is designed/implemented as there is wifi and bluetooth so the hardware is capable. However there's nothing around to run on the watch to transfer directly to anything other than an Android smartphone.. Clearly what I need is a really small Android phone with a wristband!. Please call Dexcom support and complain. I have multiple times and have been tweeting to them that it is horrible. They will let the product team know. The more they hear from us customers the more they are willing to add a change.I told them it has affected my quality of life and I am a long time Dexcom user and fan. I don't need it beeping in the middle of the night where I have to fumble with the phone to turn it off. I use the recover under my pillow for night. It is killing me at work in important exec and customer meetings or when on stage speaking. I have the watch and phone...vibrate works well when I want it to vibrate. And this past Friday was the worst going off at a movie theater in the middle of the movie. The new update now makes the phone more of a hinderance than a tool for someone who is been diabetic for 42 years with an A1C of 6.9 since my teens.We as customers can make change happen. Please call them.. Places where I silent phone and the new update goes off even though i already know what I am...SVP asked me i it was an Amber Alert in the middle of a meeting.I told dexcom I could just raise and lower my limits but that defeats wearing dexcom or I can silent but again defeats purpose I have asked them to put a feature for those that want tonto have the phone override the appThey say others have called in to complain.. Has anyone tried opening a ticket with Apple? Because technically the issue is the iPhone allowing an app to hack with the DND feature. Apple should pressure Dexcom to fix the issue because they have broken the iPhone feature for Apple customers.. I may do that complain to Apple since I just noticed today that it not only messes with the DND feature but when some of the loud alarms go off (at least the change sensor one) it also changes the volume on the phone at that point so if you happen to be listening to music with headphones say it suddenly starts blasting. Not ok. This update was clearly very rushed/inadequately tested I'm guessing in response to the FDA.. Thank you @ctv3 for all the great points here.  You are not alone - we are not alone with this.  And it is a big deal.  I have a direct email contact with one of the head development teams at Dexcom and have been in communication with him about this.  He claims that the mute override has had many complaints and that it has been escalated. It's sad because the great performance advancements in the last release have been overshadowed by the Mute Override.  They need to make it a Choice and they took that away from us terribly.. I completely agree about this awful update.  I have been in touch with them too.  I hope they change the feature.  From one rep I got the lecture about how it is a good safety feature and I stopped him in his tracks as I told him there are situations like high level work meetings and presentations where I just shut off my phone.  How's that good safety feature now?  Hopefully they will listen.. I got to that stage too but for different reasons.  The G5 was supremely flaky in terms of dropping connections.  When I went to Dexcom with the problems they told me to that my 3 month old iPhone was likely to be faulty (despite it working perfectly in every other way) and I was told I should make sure that I didn't have other apps running in the background and should remove all Bluetooth connections other than the Dexcom.  Given this advice it seemed I wasn't the first person to encounter it.  The phone has been otherwise flawless.  I pointed out that the reason I used a \"smartphone\" was because it enabled me to do lots of things and people user-behaviour isn't to go manually connecting and shutting down apps.  And converting my iPhone to be a standalone support for the Dexcom kind of goes against it's purpose.  Anyway I'm going back to the G4.  I think some at Dexcom have overlooked the fact that absolute stability of the connection between the transmitter and receiver isn't a nice to have but a bare minimum.  It's really altered my perceptions of the company. A real shame as I was a huge advocate before this happened.. I reverted to the G4 + Share configuration several months back. I understand that the G6 is estimating a 2018 introduction. So I need a Dex system to get me to the G6. Should I order a fresh G4 + Share receiver? Reading about all this alarm circus I don't think the G5 is easy to live with.. I don't think any of this applies to your situation Terry as you're using Loop on the iPhone to collect and process CGM data not the Dexcom app right?So the issue here with G4/G5 for you is does Loop support the G5 directly from the iPhone? If so you can switch to the G5 and ditch the separate Rileylink bridge.This is similar to the setup with xdrip+ on android.. does Loop support the G5 directly from the iPhone?No. Loop uses the RileyLink with both the G4 + Share and the G5. Loop does draw it's CGM data from the Dexcom Share2 app running on my iPhone. I'm still feeling my way with understanding how everything is connected and interacts but I learn a bit more each day as I work with this system.. Connectivity aside you are probably well aware the G4 transmitter is a bit slimmer than G5 and will go for up to about a year despite a 6-month warranty.. does Loop support the G5 directly from the iPhone?No. Loop uses the RileyLink with both the G4 + Share and the G5. Loop does draw it's CGM data from the Dexcom Share2 app running on my iPhone. Ah okay. Hopefully someone's working on integrating direct G5 collection into the Loop app so the Rileylink/Share component can be eliminated as it's not functionally necessary anymore with the G5. Since the code to make it work exists and is open source in xdrip+ I'd be shocked someone on the Loop side of things hasn't already looked at it and is messing with it.. so the Rileylink/Share component can be eliminated as it's not functionally necessary anymore with the G5.The MiniMed pump talks in the 916 MHz frequency range; something the iPhone cannot use. The BlueTooth frequency range is  3-4 GHz I believe. The pump RF frequency I think is what makes the RileyLink necessary.. so the Rileylink/Share component can be eliminated as it's not functionally necessary anymore with the G5.The MiniMed pump talks in the 916 MHz frequency range; something the iPhone cannot use. The BlueTooth frequency range is  3-4 GHz I believe. The pump RF frequency I think is what makes the RileyLink necessary.Okay my ignorance about the Rileylink piece. However with G4/share you still have to carry around the Dex receiver and it talks to the iPhone via BT right? So with a G5 you'd be able to eliminate the receiver hardware and read directly on the iPhone which would then record via share and Loop has the data. Problem is you have to use the Dexcom iPhone app in this situation which brings us right back to the topic of this thread.So seems like getting Loop to read directly from the G5 is the answer similar to what xdrip+ does. Hope someone's working on it!. My G4 transmitter lasted for 1 year and 2 days.  My G5 transmitters have lasted just over a quarter as long (and are the same price!).. @Dave26 - you know the G5 App development \"team\" at Dexcom isn't so big and is controlled by \"Eric\" who is known to be a bit of an opinionated butt. Does what he wants and doesn't understand customer service. From what I have heard from the guys at Dexcom. Re the lost connection as mentioned before the only time that my G5 loses the connection is when I connect my phone to my car's infotainment (BMW 5-series F11 iDrive) via bluetooth to listen to music or take a call. The communication with the G5 gets broken from that same moment and will not be re-connected until I disconnect from the car or deactivate the BT on the car. This means that every day when I'm driving to work or back home I am without the CGM.. Re the lost connectionHi.  You can fix this issue and you won't have to be w/o G5 connectivity.   Reset everything on your iPhone and set it up as a new phone not from your backup.  If you use iCloud you'll still have all your photos and data etc.  You'll still have all of your contacts too.   Just your settings will be wiped out.  All your apps you can just download again - even paid for apps.  This will fix your issue.. See my tweets to them and their CEOOthers have posted in app review on App StoreAlso please ping apple that this is a violation of app Terms of ServiceApps cannot override HW settings set by user.. I AGREE TOTALLY about the HORRIBLE G5 app update overriding Do Not Disturb on the iphone.   now when in silent-critical situations I am forced to completely disable the app giving me no readings at all like I don't even have this technology I'm paying Dexcom a fortune for.   the G5 system with readings on iphone had changed my life until Dexcom ruined it with this update.    FIX THIS DEXCOM.. Dave can you tell some more about this direct reading from an Android Wear smart watch?  Does it require the receiver to be present or read directly from the transmitter's signal?  Does it have to be a particular watch or will any Android Wear do?  Thanks for mentioning this - I hadn't heard of it!. xdrip+ has an application component in addition to just the watch faces that runs on Android Wear and can communicate directly via Bluetooth with the G5 transmitter worn on the body clipped into the sensor. An Android Wear watch with xdrip+ installed can collect G5 readings directly without either the Dexcom receiver or an Android smartphone present.When the companion smartphone the watch is linked/bound to comes back in bluetooth range and connects the watch and phone xdrip apps sync up and the captured BG readings are updated on the phone. If xdrip is configured for any of the cloud sharing systems (Dexcom's Nightscout etc.) the readings are uploaded then.xdrip+ in theory should work with any Android Wear smartwatch and Android phone combination however I have not been able to get my Huawei watch paired with my Galaxy S6 Edge to work reliably. Others have had very good success with the Sony Smartwatch 3; @Thas just got one and it playing with it.. So far my Sony Smartwatch 3 has stayed sync'd with the xDrip+ app reliably.  The only issues I've had has been with the phone losing its connection to the Dexcom Share receiver.   Some changes they made (for me?) have helped a bit with that -- If it doesn't get any signal in too long it does a reset of the connection that almost always works. They probably chose that time to minimize battery impact.   I think it does that after 20 min. of lost signals -- I wish that setting was user-modifiable (I'd make it 10 min). I do not have a G5 so I cannot vouch for that connectivity.. @Thas how much time have you spent away from the phone with only the watch collecting readings? Not looking for precision here just a rough idea.Unrelated: Did your Pebble break or otherwise have a problem? I'm curious as to why you pulled the trigger now. I don't have the G5 -- I use the G4 with Share receiver to get my data to my watch.  I don't think the app goes directly to the watch for that -- does it?  Better yet could it? My Pebble is still working but I am worried enough about the demise of the company that I want a good alternative.  I figured the Smartwatch 3 is currently available at a reasonable-enough price to give it a go  I suspect that over the course of the next year there will be other options available with longer battery life that will work -- especially with the Gear S3 sporting a bigger/longer battery (but also currently priced a bit out of my reach!).  The screen on the Sony isn't the best but it is bigger  than the Pebble and so far the battery seems long enough to be a workable solution for me for now even in the always-on mode.  Still like the Pebble better but unless I grab another before they're gone I'm afraid to rely too heavily on a \"discontinued\" product.  (Seems to be my lot - I really loved the Asante Snap right up until it Asante went belly up...). Hmmm... I have no experience with xdrip+ and the G4/bridge configuration. I was just assuming it worked with the watch standalone too because there isn't any reason it couldn't -- the connection is bluetooth just like the G5 -- unless I'm mistaken. I'm operating in the blind a bit here.... I noticed today that my iPhone had downloaded iOS 10.2. But having read this thread I did NOT install it Does anyone know if the problem with iOS 10.2 and the Apple Watch has been fixed or not yet? I do not want to install anything on my phone that is going to be a problem...... For me at least the problem wasn't with the iOS update but with specifically the Dexcom app update. I updated my iOS to the most recent version and noticed no differences before/after. I'm not using a watch though.. @cathy_elliot - what I reported was with a beta of iOS 10.2 and Watch OS. The apps work with the official release of 10.2 and Watch OS 3.1.3. The watch still does not update real-time but it is not too bad - it updates every time you make the watch app ac. Just spoke to Dexcom and even though there was a software release just yesterday they still have not rolled back the Mute Override or given us an option to turn that off.  This will not get fixed unless more people complain to them.  So if you hate that the Dexcom alarms cannot be muted please call Dexcom and complain.We should have the option to not override the Mute.. Has anyone gotten anywhere with a response from Dexcom regarding this? We just got switched to the new app in Canada and I miss my silence toggle so much!. The tech support guys are on board with needing the silence back. They tell me they hear the complaint a lot but they and an insider I know say the lead app developer is just unwilling to do what he believes is incorrect.I still believe the user should have a choice and not be required to go into the menu to silence everything. I am sometimes in meetings where vibrate would be sufficient but to take the option away is unacceptable in my opinion.They are hiring an iOS development manager so hopefully it will be someone with an ear for listening to customers.. Mine says Version 1.7.1I don't think I'm having issues with the alarm feature?I haven't had my DND on for a couple of weeks though.But I do think the last session expiration alarm was very loud and thinking I didn't remember it being that loud.. I haven't had my DND on for a couple of weeks though.DND?Edited to add: It finally came to me. I think your acronym decodes to \"do not disturb.\". Besides silence there also needs to be the option to modulate the volume on the alerts. Loud alerts are fine sometimes but sometimes I want audible but not jarringly loud ones and the all or nothing of that makes my Dex so much less useful since I feel the need to keep it on vibrate most of the time now and I miss the alerts as a result.. Yes . the all or nothing of that makes my Dex so much less useful since I feel the need to keep it on vibrate most of the time now and I miss the alerts as a result.I think unnecessary alarm fatigue that leads to missed urgent alarms makes a persuasive argument. This could all be settled so easily if Dexcom would simply allow some customizable user settings.I have no inside knowledge but I would expect the intrusive G5 alarms will be changed for the G6. I fear the G5 is now stuck in Dexcom/FDA cement.The antidote to this is a robust and well-funded user study before submission to the regulators. I've never been able to find documentation that describes this process. Maybe it's another one of those \"proprietary\" details that companies wish to hide.. I keep my phone on vibrate which works well now that I have an Apple Watch. Although I miss a lot of vibration alerts on my phone I don't miss them on the watch very often. I think that I get one (or two?) chances to dismiss the Urgent Low 55 alarm before it sounds.My biggest annoyance is that unlike the first generation of the Apple Watch G5 app I have to respond to alerts on my phone. I can hit Dismiss on my watch but the alerts keep coming back until I dismiss it on my phone. As much as I am a fan of Dexcom I find it hugely intrusive and not necessarily giving me more protection as it gets more intrusive. Occasionally at night when I need it the most for safety I have been known to shut it down so I can get some decent sleep. I think a lot of my frustrations come when I am hovering near 70 or near 160 (my thresholds) and I keep getting an alarm every time I pass over the threshold. Or when I've corrected a low and I keep getting alerted because it takes the Dex such a long time to recover.It's been a long time since I used Medtronic sensors but back with my 523 I could silence all alarms for a certain period of time. Say an hour or two if I was going to be in a meeting or at church. I have always wished that Dexcom had that feature.. I think a lot of my frustrations come when I am hovering near 70 or near 160 (my thresholds) and I keep getting an alarm every time I pass over the threshold.Goodness yes this! When it wakes me up and I correct/eat it takes a while to work and in the meantime I just want to go to sleep! Lately I just change the alert so that I don't hit it again while it sorts itself out but then I forgot to reset it back.... Occasionally at night when I need it the most for safety I have been known to shut it down so I can get some decent sleep. I think a lot of my frustrations come when I am hovering near 70 or near 160 (my thresholds) and I keep getting an alarm every time I pass over the threshold.I remember one night in particular when my upper threshold alarm set at 140 (7.8) woke me up. I took a small insulin dose to address it. Then my blood sugar line oscillated about the 140 line over under over under as if it had demon eyes! I think I finally boosted the threshold but by that time my night's rest was thoroughly compromised.. This might be answered in the previous 2 or 3 pages.  I too am quite annoyed by the alert sound level - it is only really useful if you have hypoglycemia unawareness.  As well if I see that my BG is 71 and so I eat 20g glucose.  Then my BG drops down to 64 which is below my \"urgent low\" threshold of 65 - either because my BG was already dropping or because my pancreas managed to still produce a bit of (unneeded) insulin - and the alpha cells don't work anymore.Either way I get an extremely loud beep which I don't need - I already know my BG is low!  As well for some reason I don't start to \"lose function\" until my BG goes below about 40 even though I know that it's low.  (Or lower - why my body can seemingly function normally all the way down to 35 sometimes I have no idea..)Does anyone have the IPA file of the old app?  (Or will I have to jailbreak the phone and figure out how to hack the app or figure out how to use xDrip?  Or I suppose just put up with it but I'd rather not.)I do hope that Apple only lets very critical applications have this \"Override Do-Not-Disturb\" entitlement.. I had the same problem with the alarm volume.  My husband said it was so loud that it might give him a heart attack!   It was seriously disturbing and I went back to the G4.  Does anyone know if progress has been made on this issue as of June 2017??. I'm still on the G4 but the receiver goes way too crazy when I'm low.  I don't understand why it has to alert me again when my blood sugar is rising and passes the low threshold!. I am now using an Apple Watch and it has somehow muted all sound from my phone aside from the urgent low. Really helpful for at work!. Are you using the Apple Watch direct from the transmitter to the watch or is it still going through your iPhone first and then retransmitted to the watch?. it has somehow muted all sound from my phone aside from the urgent low.This is very doable anywayit's only the urgent low alarms you can't turn to vibrate. My issue is that I can't easily switch them all from audible to vibrate with the phone's own button because I now just keep them all on vibrate (except urgent low and rising/dropping) and I tend to miss alarms as a result... that said I haven't recent updated the app so I'm curious anyone who has any thoughts/issues/improvements in the latest version?. The calibration alert cycles every 12 hours so you have to be aware that if you calibrate at 3 in the afternoon  the alert will come on a 3 a.m. You can reset the 12 hour cycle by calibrating at say 7 in the evening so the next alert will be a 7 in the morning.. Haha. Have been hating the new unsuitable unmutable alarms.And also this with temporarily turning up phone volume to max. I suppose I almost blasted some speakers today at least scared my kids. It is a Sonos system and if you start some old Madonna track on the WiFi controlled speakers then leave the phone which goes into sleep mode. Now the volume up/down on the phone means turning sonos system up/down. Guess what happens when I get a Dexcom alarm... Madonna becomes really loud.. Hi there. I share your grievance about theinability to mute Dexcom G5 alarms. Ive called their customer service and they couldntdo a thing about it. It may have had something to do with getting FDA approval byhaving this alarm immutable. Who knows?On the one hand Im glad that Dexcom is lookingafter me and it motivates me to take care of business. On the other hand I wish that the whole world didnt have to know my business about blood sugars!. Which version of the app are you having the problems with and is it the Apple or Android app?I ask as we are not having this issue on the Apple v 1.7.1.Currently available for Apple download is v 1.7.2 - which has the very unhelpful description of changes as:Performance enhancements and bug fixes\n",
      "Geeks come in many different distributions...I'm a primarily a UNIX PHP Javascript with a bunch of other stuff thrown in (ruby perl python yadda yadda yadda)What makes you tick?. Dang I feel so unqualified to be in this club! I built my own business site and can muddle through html and css sort of okay but nothing like any of that . I like the design side of things best. I'm hoping some real geekiness will rub off on me and make this stuff easier!. Oh no a geek is not determined by skill level. Heck I know TONS of people who are much more technical than me. Its only qualification is interest. We're all here to learn from each other. I bet you can teach me a thing or two ( or fifty) about HTML and CSS.. I used to be a UNIX admin in a previous life (FreeBSD baby!). Now that I have kids and a different job I don't mess around with much of it anymore.Besides I was more of a wannabe UNIX admin. It was the really smart geeks in the group really ran the show. . What do you do now?. I worked for a number of years in a research lab (Sarnoff) where I did some minor work with a team of very smart PhD types developing the first MPEG-4 codec (the last time I ever really used my engineering degree). I was seduced by the dark side of the force (web application development) in the 90s and and switched to developing LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL Perl) based web sites and applications for financial and pharmaceutical firms. I spend most of my free time researching new programming and security technologies. At work I am a heavy Linux user but at home I have found myself spending a lot of my time on OS X AJAX and PHP.. sweet! we should combine all of our skills and do something cool.. I like to think I am fluent in many different geek forms but masters of none. I have done everything from testing security software on odd unix platforms (AIX and HPUX rock) to managing a datacenter. (whos add is oddly on the page believe it or not) Now days I am in charge of the OSX and unix machines for the labs at Texas A&M but there are alot of people much smarter then I am working here that I have to lean on from time to time.As for hobbies though I love a soldering iron. My brother is the EE major so he gets alot of questions when I don't know what I am doing but it is SO much fun to build something like a NIXIE clock from scratch.btw all you web devs have my respect. There is no way that I could do half the stuff that you have to deal with.. you should post some pix of the NIXIE clocks. I wish I could build one.. I work primarily with Windows servers. ASP Active Directory LDAP DNS DFS SQL.Yes it's a GUI based OS but if it can be scripted I have probably done it. I write mostly in vbscript now because thats what the rest of my co-workers understand. I learned Perl before MS released vbscript and Perl still wins hands down.We also have VMWare GSX & ESX hosts did some Citrix in a previous job. Supported some Unix a few jobs ago and still dabble with Linux from time to time. My home system will probably run Linux soon. Afraid to let any of that questionable Vista DRM get near my media. Can write HTML by hand when necessary and do javascript CSS occasionally.I have enjoyed watching Star Trek Farscape Firefly.Although I have never been to a Trek convention or dressed as one of the characters.Why is there no longer and good sci-fi on tv?Is Heroes sci-fi? I mean it's on NBC.... hmm.. i guess geek factor puts me right up at the top. I work as a programmer on linux aix hp and solaris in c/c++/python/perl and dabbling in java or anything else that's the flavour of the month.can't say that i've been to a Trek convention but do Anime and Sci-Fi ones count as geeky? ^_^. Thats about what the one I made looks like. I need to take pictures of it when I get around to making a case for it. Right now you can kinda fry yourself as it runs at mains voltage. . .. Do you have the clock on the board is it hooked to your computer? If you have it hooked into serial or USB you can output all sort of other data (temperature stock price etc). I wish I could say that I did. Unfortunatly I am not that awsome at this point in time. It just displays the time based on mains current. I'm a Systems Architect and Director of I.T. these days... It's been a long time since I've written any code.I'm a UNIX/LINUS Geek at heart although these days I'm dealing almost exclusively in Infrastructure (Servers/Storage/Networks).I spent 10 years at Disney most of them at the Feature Animation Studio as the head of Systems and got to do cool things things like build and manage a Top500 Supercomputing Cluster for Rendering Images. (Not to mention the half Petabyte of spinning disk behind it). By no means a \"guru\" but I get by ;0) Graphics HTML CSS PHP CGI/Perl (can't flat out write PHP/CGI/Perl code but can install use and edit/customize/fix[usually]). Build my own puters (never owned a \"branded\" one) fix'em myself (and just about everyone elses I know too! UGH). Only know Windows 95 98 & XP though.. Primarily web design/development and graphic design though those skills have lapsed much in the last few years.Professionally I work in video game development mostly on the QA side of things but somewhat in design. Just the fact that my work is in video games gives me quite a bit of geek cred though I think.... I'm more a \"geek by association.\" My husband is the real geek and I just cling stubbornly to my Mac ways and pretend I know what I'm talking about when my parents can't get their copy of Office to behave. I've been playing Civilization IV and Ultima 5: Lazarus lately if that's any props there.I'm a science fiction nerd to the core and have a ridiculous collection of sci-fi/fantasy novels as proof. (whiny voice a la Urkel) So can I be in the club? (/whiny voice). Welcome SarahI know more geeks who are Mac fans than Windows. I have been using a Mac since 1989 ( not the same one of course!)Currently I am on a MacBook Pro. I love this thing. It gives me the pretty interface and UNIX under the hood.. I've had a Mac since 1993 my first one was a Performa. I bought an iMac when I went off to college in 2000 and upgraded to a titanium Powerbook 15\" when I started graduate school. My next purchase will probably be a MacBook or an iMac but my laptop still has a lot of life left in it. Yay Macs!While Macs do seem to be a bit of a geek thing I've managed to keep my folks happily Apple-ensconced. Though my dad did go with a PC laptop and immediately regretted it when he realized that it came with Vista. Macs are just so much more pleasant to use if you don't want to deal with any of the inner workings of your computer. And they're way prettier.It's funny whenever I talk to anyone with an insulin pump they always want to make it talk to their Mac even when they are admitted computer novices. Why is that?. Hey everyone I just stumbled across this group. Hope it's ok if I join!I don't do any programming at all. I'm tech support primarily Macintosh. (And very prejudiced towards my Mac babies yes I am.) I have experience in both Windows and Mac OS but I do love my apples.I can do the website design stuff too but it's not my cuppa. lolAnyway glad to be here among fellow geeks. waves~Kelly. I'm a geek with no programming skills whatsoever. Although I have to admit that I \"nerd out\" when it comes to electronics and the like.. That makes me tick! As for me I am an Electrical Engineer originally: I used to dive deep into assembly level programming for a while and loved it... towards the end of my undergrad work I became exposed to Signal Processing and Audio Compression and loved it: those where the days when the word MP3 was not a popular term (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 was the way we referred to it). My undergrad thesis had to do with the implementation of the Cosine Transform and Huffman Compression to an existing code base for MPEG Audio: it was my C-language baptism.Then I came to the use for grad work and was introduced to the web... HTML CGI and JavaScript first... and though I spent the next four years doing Electrical Engineer work at Procter & Gamble the web stayed my true passion. So in 2000 I came back and since then I've only been doing web-related work: content management community management product management project management IT management etc.The last time I had to throw a REAL line of code was back in 2003. Since then it's been mostly basic HTML and a focus on product content and community development.That was long! . I'm a web programmer (php mysql object orientated). Funny how being diabetic has made me much more aware of accessibility issues on websites!Also Anime/SciFi Geek + Bookworm.. I'm more of a wannabe geek.I run a website and I made it all myself but I stumbled through it as I never really learnt HTML. Plenty of advice on the web and footling around as I went and it's worked well enough I like computers - building them fixing them spending too much time on them... My friends & family call me when there's a problem and it's quite an ego boost to be able to tinker with something and make it work again I just love toys! Whether it's a video camera or a BG meter it's all buttons & beeps to me and I like to learn about what makes them tick and how I can play with them. Even as a kid I was always pulling things apart and trying to make them better / faster / broken piles of bits that sat around forever waiting for me to put them back together... hehehe. I think I'd probably call myself a wannabe geek too. I'm a second level internet helpdesk tech and a dedicated Mac user too.. Currently Java (for GUI/Database access) and C++ for high-speed processing data acquisition and control. I'm pretty much stuck in Windows because of my customers. I also occasionally do some embedded software and systems level design.In past lives: Fortran Ada Assembly Basic Pascal VMS Unix SEL (anyone ever heard of that?) etc.. I'm an ancient geek. Been workign with the damn things for 27 years now! Started life in BASIC on an Apple II and a Commodore PET. Went on to do all sorts of stuff. COBOL on minis through to hardware design and PLMxx and ASM/xx Was big on Transputers if anyone remembers them; I even wrote TransDOS. LOL.Unix stuff too. I had a Sun 3/260 when that was a real beast. A pair of 500MB Fujitsu Eagle drives that nearly broke your back if you tried to lift them.I now do technician stuff and web design/hosting. I still write a bit of software too. Delphi is my preferred dev tool I can't stand the MS IDE. Build and sell machines too.Thinking about it - ancient geek is about right particularly from the PC point of view. I was around for the birth of them!. Another \"ancient geek\" here. I started out writing assembly language code for IBM's System 370 based email database program in 1980 and also did a lot of work with a never-released to the public interpreter language that was the precursor of REXX.After that I worked in most of the old mainframe environments. I learned C but never felt motivated to write software in it but driven by need I have written a bunch of perl scripts for my own web sites. A few years ago I fell in love with PHP and I've written quite a lot of fairly complex server side stuff using it. It really lends itself to using a lot of tricks that I learned in the bad old days when you did all your own indexing and didn't rely on databases. It amazes me the way I never get tired of writing software!I feel very strongly that my background in debugging very large complex poorly documented systems gave me the mindset I needed to figure out diabetes. I pretty much have had to treat what doctors tell me the way you treat most manuals. Possibly helpful but don't trust anything you haven't checked out on your own system. And the only way to really understand how things work is to change one thing observe draw a conclusion test the conclusion and very slowly work your way towards understanding the effects that the different changes you make have.. I am more of a dabbler than an expert.Started with COBOL and Pascal and now do mostly VB VBA and Windows script (or VBscript). However I generally do not do much coding.I have done my share of sysadmin stuff on HPUX and SunOS. And System Admin for Lawson Insight Financials. As well as Oracle DBA support for financial applications.Cognos Crystal Report et alNow I mostly do Business Analysis and Project Management.Jack. I do audio and video work mostly but I'm learning to use Catalyst Framework to make web databases. I'm a big fan of Unices and networking plus I'm a mobile junkie Palm especially.. Don't laugh (or if you are young geek of the new generation go \"huh???) I first learned programming in Basic GOTO Line 10. RUN. Then onto C+ (no it's not a grade) then wow C++! Anyone here remember the days of Lotus 123 & Symphony when you got to call yourself a programmer for creating macros?I am a self-taught geekette thanks to \"For Dummies\" books in HTML PHP and Javascript (which I can prove by the wrinkles on my face from debugging in the early \"me still dummy\" days). I now know enough to know I don't know enough but I still love it and feel geek-qualified j...u...s...t enough to proudly wear my oversized t-shirt that says: \"Programming - Turning caffeine into code.\" Well I did wear it until my kids hid it from me and lovingly replaced it with \"Go have a nice day somewhere else\" (sort of my response when they interrupt me at work or my BG drops below 60). But sadly that shirt too mysteriously went \"missing\" the first time I laundered it. Go figure.. I'm with Kris on this one. I do A/V work but I program AMX systems. They're basically \"fancy expensive\" touch panels that control a \"rich\" person's audio video heating lighting security etc. So the language I deal with is called NetLinx sort of a derivitive of C# in my opinion. I dabble here and there with C# making little applications that probably only get used once by me then get put on the back burner.. Hi !My geek-ines is mostly centered on Java (GUI/Db/ little JSP) but I am quite good programmer in some other languages: C# mainly since in last two years most of my official work is in that but from previous occupation C++/C and quite good knowledge of other OSes: FreeBSD Linux OS/2 (that one was really good but then IBM started installing Windows on their computers...)...Thats all for now...Andz. you are such a geek manny!. if i had to write my geekette bio it would sound exactly like yours! add - part of the creation team at Citicorp that created the software that developed Interstate Banking. Moving off of humongous tape drives. This was in 1987!. It's been a while since I've done any real programming except for the occasional Matlab program in the research labs I'm in at school now. I've also had experience in Maple C++ Visual Basic Python and a bit of webpage design.A few of my friends also claim that I \"carry around more gagets than James Bond\" which is why I joined more than anything. Aside from the pump and meter I've also usually got my mp3 player PDA\\cellphone my laptop and sometimes my PSP.. Boy am I going to date myself on this one... Here's a list of the programming languages I've used to write at least one piece of production code in in the order I last used them. I'll start with the current ones so I don't feel so old:JavaAdobe Flex (ActionScript 3.0)PHPC++CJSPPythonC#PerlCobol370 AssemblerFocus 4GLMark 4DEC VAX AssemblerPascalBasicOh the humanity.. Open source Unix PHP and long complicated MySQL queries. I need to learn some Java or C++ as soon as I can get around to it. . Cisco network security and VoIP geek by trade.Consumer electronic and video game geek for fun.. I would be considered a web design geek. I know everything there is to know about web design and I find something I don't know about I learn about it. I have an Associates degree in Web Development but continue my education on my own. My bachelor's degree isn't in computers or IT things. I'm a psychology major actually.. I'm mostly an applied math / numerical computing geek. Professionally I do signals analysis and signal processing reconstruction etc. Academically I have a master's in applied math and scientific computation focusing on digital signal processing and am working on my PhD in the same field developing dimensionality reduction and analysis methodology for hyperspectral data. In my spare time (what little I have) I'm a gadget geek and love sci-fi and fantasy novels have attended anime conventions and have played and DMed D&D campaigns.In the past when I was in high school I ran my own business doing small software development projects and building computers for others. I worked in IT/MIS (back when it was called \"Management Information Systems\") in academy both at a public schools office and at two universities for a total of roughly 9 years. Now I work at a defense engineering company in a small research group. I've built my own machines and fixed them for others. I have machines running Win Linux and OS X and have programmed in C/C++ Java Fortran Matlab Perl VisualBasic Pascal Basic and have tinkered in C# and Python. I've also written webstuff in HTML/CSS and a bit of PHP. I've also dabbled occasionally in robotics but nothing big.What makes me tick is the excitement of a really cool result after a long struggle.. I know this comment is almost a year old but I have to reply that I totally agree with your third paragraph. I started out as a technical editor and then a tech writer for UNIX system administrator software in 1990 then moved into marketing and PR writing for a few giant software companies then got in on the dot-com thing just as it was starting to die and now I do design and graphics for print and the Web (still do some writing on the side as well). But getting back to your remark  like probably a lot of people in this group I have the kind of mind that likes figuring out puzzles  the bigger and more complicated the better  so learning to manage my diabetes has been ... I can't really say it's been fun but I have found it very satisfying in some ways. Nothing like having a theory to test ... and test ... and test again  until I finally figure out how it all works. At least until it starts working some other way (as I'm learning is often the case with diabetes)  and then  I get to test some more!. Scratch that psychology degree part. I was offered a job if I went back to school for graphic design to add to my web development degree. I decided to do it. I also get a new laptop computer through the school. MAC book Pro with all the software I need to get through school.. I'm a mac geek I don't do a lot of coding or the like but I write all my papers in LaTeX and blog posts in Markdown. TextMate is probably the greatest thing in the world. I suppose in reality I'm more of a nerd than a geek.... Haven't done much programming since a few small things in university (BASIC and FORTRAN). Started getting into HTML until everything moved over to XML and I ran out of time to keep up. Been building my own PCs since 1990. I've done tech support for MS-DOS Windows 3.1 thru XP various Web-based applications and VoIP. Did a little bit of LAN admin in a security-unfriendly environment (the boss insisted on disabling all security across the network) -- NetWare 3.12 and WinNT 4.0.Have fun with photography and graphics but I'm not deep enough into it to do much with it.Got into renfaire costuming a few years ago going moderately deep into 16th Century women's attire and perforce picking up a bit of 15th- and 16th-century art history. Current project is a Court Suit in the Spanish style for a teddy bear who travels around to the local faires.Not a first-generation TREK fan but I've been in STARFLEET since 1985 and I have made my own \"monster maroons\". Due to weight fluctuations I doubt they currently fit.. I love renfaire costuming. I used to work for the MN RenFest when I was living in Iowa but that has been years ago. Unfortunately I did not have the money to go to the one in Utah this year but hopefully I will be able to go next year.Another thing that that is like a renfaire except its for goths is called the Dark Arts Festival here in Salt Lake City. Its actually coming up soon this weekend.. Was an electronic engineer specializing in logic simulation until a stroke forced me to retire early.My first 3 home computers were probably Altair 8800 Altair 8800A and Altair 8800B all purchased used and with enough model name plates removed I couldn't be sure.

Hmmm how much do I want to date myself? LOL Started out with fortran/cards in a previous life I think. My web sites are php/html/css. I have a win 7 laptop linux netbook android phone (gave up on my previously beloved palms) and just got an Ipad 2 (gave up on waiting for a good honeycomb tablet). I started/ran an IRC network back in the days.You're all waaaaaaay more up-to-date than I am!. I also started with FORTRAN/cards. I never saw the computer I used in those days but it was probably an IBM 360 over in the next county.Used many BBS sites before I started using the internet.Thinking of switching to Windows 7 once I get past some problems retrieving old data.Have never used Linux.. Ah yes the Fortran cards. Submit fifty cards for an assignment wait a week and find out it would not compile because of missing space on the first card. I so loved having my own computer when I built my own Apple ][ back in 1981.Now I am about to try to teach some Basic to a grade four class that knows more about the internet than I do but whose biggest challenge is that they don't understand English very well.Meanwhile at home in the evenings I am struggling with PIC devices and learning C++.. I don't think any of those grade fours would appreciate sitting at a monitor for hours playing Adventure  My first fortran project was a monopoly game LOL. My university was at least faster about getting the resulting printouts back - often the next day.My first three home computers were various Altair 8800 models all purchased used.Grade 4 sounds like an age when they'd like some of the computer games I've read about that have some effect in preventing obesity and hopefully diabetes as well - those that involve quite a bit of movement of the players. Some of the Wii games are suitable but don't offer any opportunity for users to do any programming to change them.I'm already trying to learn C and planning to learn C++ as well so that I can try helping some of the BOINC projects I'm interested in. Possibly CUDA or OpenCL later.If you're looking for free Basic compilers you might want toevaluate these:http://www.freebasic.net/http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/basic.shtmlhttp://www.freebyte.com/programming/basic/http://www.freeprogrammingresources.com/basic.htmlhttp://justbasic.com/http://www.freebasiccompiler.com/http://www.freebyte.com/programming/compilers/envelop.htmlhttp://www.compilers.net/Dir/Free/Compilers/Basic.htmhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/Or if interpreters seem more suitable these:http://galacticelectronics.com/NewBasic.HTMLhttp://www.freeware-guide.com/dir/softdev/basic.htmlhttp://www.fuerve.com/works/BASIC/http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/http://www.yabasic.de/. Thanks. I have been using the justbasic compiler maybe I'll check out some of the others later.My first computer was a used KIM single board with a teletype and a tape recorder to store and load programs. It used the 6502 microprocessor the same as the Apple][ I later built. I spent many fun happy hours entering code in hex and then debugging it using a keypad and seven-segment readouts. It had a total of 2K RAM but it could play chess!Meanwhile back at school in the present I am told I should teach my class about DOS. That should be fun.. Jareb are you teaching a history class? LOL. Which DOS - the IBM mainframe DOS or the DOS for PCs? I've used both.. Actually I am teaching DOS structure a bit but I'm using the command line interface of Windows XP which is what our computers run here.Mostly I just want my grade four students to realize how much easier a GUI makes tasks rather than having to spell everything out correctly. Their computer skills are much better than their English so just navigating around directories is hard for them.. I started out in 82 with a C64 writing all kinds in BASIC  Then came the Amiga (what a wonderful machine) and the Atari but it wasn't until 89 i think I got bitten by the code bug (not the faulty bug) and bought a 386 machine. I used turbo pascal a bit assembly (MASM i think it was?!) VB and dived into C. Then the spiral just went boom - coding is my way of life; I even made it past COBOL for mainframes (lol). What language I use depends on what I create; If it's web; JS (jQuery)/CSS/HTML(5)/PHP (I love the codeigniter framework) mobile (Java/LUA) desktop (C#/Java/Python) (on pure OS X apps i use Objective-C).What really fascinates me is AI/Machine learning/ Multi-Agent Systems.Do others here also get a kick of wathcing re-runs of \"Computer Chronicles\"?  And yes OS/2 was a good OS in it's time!. My first computer was an Amiga agreed it was a great machine.. I am a mcse certified and basically a gadget girl. I love any techie gadget and everyone comes to me for computer to photography...... Started out as desktop support. Worked my way up to a mid-level Systems Admin. I work mainly with biotech servers and applications but also am now getting into Enterprise-level VMWare/VSphere.. Any VMWare/VSphere experts out there? I'm just starting out-- you know how it works-- get \"thrown\" into something and expected to pick it up right away in a mid- sized enterprise. And I'm finding none of the departments talk to each other... Virtual peeps are supposed to need assistance and work with the network and storage guys. I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall! Dudes--- I DON'T want your job trust me!! I just need to know your setup so I can effectively do my job!! (I think they're really paranoid since there's been layoffs.) I do not nor do I want to be a Network or Storage Expert LOL. I've got VMWare installed but haven't done enough with it yet to think of claiming to be an expert. About all I've done with vSphere is look at a web site for it.. I have a degree in both web development and graphic design. My strength area is HTML and CSS. I also do work with Game Art and writing the stories for games as well. So I also do a lot of XBOX 360 playing and play WoW as well. Just started playing that actually.. I'm an electrical engineer with an emphasis in power electronics (motors generators transmission lines the grid etc.). I did work for EPICS (Engineering Project in Community Service) at my university when I was there and so I got to play with other electrical engineering toys and code more. My husband is an aeronautical/astronautical engineer and works on jet engines. He's my rocket scientist plane/space expert.We both play video games and yell at the movies/tv shows when they don't get the physics right and also have random silly nerd conversations about the speed of gravity or putting a turbine in a car and occasionally write a simple little code (MATLAB is what we both tend to use) to graph out a message.. Hi I am new both to tuDiabetes and this group. Not to diabetes though (17 years +).What kind of geek am I? The \"dinosaur\" kind: IBM mainframe dating to the 360 era.:). I'm not really a geek. (More of a wannabe-a-geek who has worked with a lot of geeks.) But I do want to find some geeks to help develop a software-as-a-service mobile app idea I have. You can see the whole idea in my post here. In short though it is:Crowdsource anonymize and aggregate relevant data from Type 1 geeks and smartphone users globally. For example:If you could help out with this or know people who can let's try and get folks together to make it happen. Seriously.Besides the quant jocks we'd need somebody for UX design (gather requirements design interface) someone to build the app and the accompanying website a project manager etc.If you can help reply here or in this thread.Thanks!!. I am more of a \"personal\" geek. I usually build/repair my desktops. I was once a \"system admin\" for an old Wang mid frame. That was far from what an sys admin would do now. I would add new users write macros for WP modify COBOL code and the once weekly back up to tapes. I also remember using a machine to make cards I also learned how to read what was on those cards but don't think I can do it now. That was for the Army back in the 80's.  Now I play with different things for personal satisfaction even though I write simple SQL at work. I sometimes help friends with their PC problems. Like with the d I am always eager to learn new stuff.Star date: 2456178.923611. (Oh yeah star trek fan too). Wow. I hadn't thought about Wang in YEARS. In the pre-PC era I worked for a Wang competitor (maker of standalone word processing systems). Ah nostalgia.. Ancient geek. Cut my teeth fixing TVs filled with actual tubes. First computer was an IBM 360/64. First programming language FORTRAN. I speak Basic C C++ several dialects of Lisp and Prolog. On the job I use Perl PHP and occasionally Java. First computer I ever owned was a Timex/Sinclair. My current machine runs Slackware Linux. At work I get to play with a 260 node cluster running Solaris.Like I said. Ancient. Love to discover how things work. Bugs me I can't get data out of my glucometer and play with it with my own code.. Hello fellow \"geeks\":I am this kind of geek:a. A researcher with background in product innovation marketing intelligence (sounds like a military department doesn't it? But it's just the name of a department at my former company) consumer and futures research and organizational knowledge management.b. I am currently completing an MFA in Transdisciplinary Design. What's that? A fancy name for knowledge brokering (in my case) using information scannning discussion and mapping.. I'm not much of a programmer (some basic HTML + Javascripts dabbled in C++) but I do read a lot of scifi (major Asimov fan) and I do have a Stack Exchange account for whatever that's worth.\n",
      "Hi guysBeing new to this site I figured this would probably be the best group to ask about what you guys use for actively monitoring your blood sugar readings your insulin dose and what you eat??Like most people I know in IT I spend most of my time in a variety of meetings with constant interuptions at my desk and a very varied and unplanned day... often resulting in me not actively tracking my blood sugars my insulin dosages and what I eat. I've therefore been searching to find a better solution so I can easily keep track of this info and ultimately so I can better control my readings.I've got a blackberry pearl with access to my email and internet so something which could allow me to quickly post to a site using my phone (not using Ajax) or by sending a quick email to a personalised blog style email address which takes the info and adds to my database online. Alternatively was thinking of maybe buying an HP iPaq or something small which I could use my own excel spreadsheet which I could then customise.Not too keen on using one of the software solutions that come with blood sugar readers as from what I've tried so far it appears that you have to upload and knowing my busy day it won't happen unless I can send results and details there and then. Plus the blood sugar readers available in Australia seem a bit primative compared to the rest of the world.Any tips war stories or opinions therefore greatfully appreciated!. I don't know much about the blackberry pearl but why not set up a simple spreadsheet? Same as a log book but on your pda. If you get that you can later import that over to your desktop when you sync it and then use some nice statistical tools to give you outputs the way you want. There are some nice free ones out there or just write out the equasion and impliment it into excel. That is a good way to waste a few hours if you ask me setting up the spreadsheet the way you want. From there it would be REALLY easy to graph out your trends on carb consumption insulin taken and then the resulting b/g levels.I did a quick search and there are a TON of excel add-ons for the blackberry. Why carry around 2 devices when one will do the job for you?. I use a (shareware) program called Palm Diabetic Diary. I'm happy with it so far.I haven't used many others (one other freeware program that I didn't like much) but this one gives me what I need. There's a diary graphs for daily levels daily averages weekly levels and weekly averages. It has fields for entering medication (but I'm controlled by d+e so I've never used those) and I suggested adding exercise fields to the developer and he very kindly added in my suggestion (it's a nice little 'nag'/reminder field for me!).. I'm still looking for the best solution for me. The software that runs with my meter is okay but it doesn't do everything I want. I've figured out how to manually export the data (see my blog for that) at least so I can run it into excel and play with it now and then.Sugar stats looks interesting but filling in endless mini forms is just not something I can keep up. Unfortunately there isn't a way yet to upload my meter results.I have a feeling I'll end up coding something myself eventually!. I use a very low tech approach. I find paper logs work better for me than software and I've trained myself to NEVER give an insulin shot without writing it down with the time and dose. I often note what I ate or physical activity on the log if I end up with an unexpected result. I carry a small notebook in my purse for when I'm not by my log and enter the same information there.It's simple but it works. The most important part is training myself to never use insulin without writing it down.. You should definitely checkout these two web sites: SugarStats.com and Calorie King. The Calorie King Nutrition and Exercise Manager is a food and exercise diary coupled with a large food database.\"SugarStats makes it simple to track monitor and share your blood sugar levels and other key statistics to help you manage your diabetes online.\" -- SugarStats.comSugarStats.com also provides a mobile version that you may use from your Blackberry. I wrote up a review here.It may be a bit extreme but I carry around a MacBook on which I log my food intake into Calorie King and if I am near a WiFi hot spot I can update my BG info on SugarStats. I have to carry around all my diabetes supplies anyway.. KhurtIt occurs to me that one difference between me and many of the folks here is that I've had diabetes for so long that I've actually memorized the carb counts of just about any food I'd ever eat. That really helps.I forget how tough it must be to someone who is new to this who doesn't have a brain stuffed full of nutritional information! I spent a couple months at diagnosis carrying around a book and looking up everything and many months logging what I ate into software until the sheer obsessiveness of it got to me and I decided it was time to untether. But by then I'd gotten to where I could look at a piece of food and have a pretty good idea what was in it carb-wise.Eventually it does get programmed into the brain and you pretty much just look up the occasional thing you aren't sure of. It's not all that different from the way that a lot of us weekly grocery shoppers know the prices of all the stuff we usually buy well enough that if the clerk rings it up wrong we can catch it.. I use http://www.sugarstats.com but I guess you could say I'm biased  But then again it was created because I was asking many of the same questions as you above.I used to have a blackberry too. Though I always have a browser open when I'm not its easy for me to email in my readings/meds etc or use the mobile version on my phone. Twitter.com integration coming soon When it comes down to it I think for people like us on the go we have to make it as easy as possible and provide many options for input.. I started off with a custom Excel workbook long before I had a reasonable data uplink cable for my blood glucose meter. While I can work the basics with Co-Pilot I really need something that will also accommodate daily weight periodic blood pressure readings and complete dietary and exercise information (not just \"carbs\" and \"intense/moderate/duration\"). Unfortunately the online food database I was using went pffft when I wasn't looking there are a number of obvious errors in the USDA database and none of the other online databases I've seen measure foods out in grams. (Do not trust volume equivalents they are EXTREMELY variable!) So right now I'm a bit betwixt-and-between there as I take my downloaded version of SR20 and correct the errors. MS Access 2007 has a built-in nutrition database but again the quantities are unusable and there are similar errors to the USDA database. Also it does not allow for any health information other than weight and basic exercise info. I use PolarFitnessTrainer (online) and my Polar F6 watch to keep track of my exercise data.When I am \"offline\" I just copy the information onto a paper log and transcribe it when I get back to my Excel workbook.Extremely inefficient but it works for me.BTW the Excel workbook also has a spreadsheet to keep track of my lab readings and a separate dietary-function spreadsheet as well as my general log.\n",
      "So this might just be me but I love to have the latest reporting software so that I can graph trends and run statistics on my insulin amounts or blood sugars. Right now I am just using the website that mini-med provides and then outputing that data into excel so that I can make prettier graphs.With the release of this new OpenMoko phone though how hard do you think it will be to have it recieve the radio signal and then report the information to a simple sql database. You could then keep everything right on you! Why you would want to do that I am not sure but it would be cool!. Chuck Lin wrote:Hi SeanI'm looking at mobile strategies for my company.

Wait do you mean you can get your info out of Carelink and put it into Excel? Or do you mean the other software? I didn't see any way to download it but perhaps having to use Explorer blinded me.I am a total diabetes geek. I use Carelink download my UltraSmart (although the software is pretty limited) and use my Palm TX to track food and carbs (with Calorie King) which I can sync to my desktop. I tried Diabetes Pilot for awhile but it wasn't the thing for me. When I was having to track things for my endo I made my own Excel spreadsheet and synced it to my Palm so I could input the data in real time (otherwise I never would have done it). It worked out pretty well.I am considering getting a Helio Ocean but continuing to carry my Palm; I don't really mind having both.. I am just porting it out right now by hand. Big PITA but it gets the job done. Their reports are good but it is fun to find the standard deviance and stuff like that.. You're hardcore!. I use the CareLink website pretty regularly and mess with the graphs etc but that's about it. My endo loves that I use it. She says there aren't many out there that take advantage of the website.I was so happy when I got my Mac mini at home though so I could run Parallels and boot it into Windows to use the site. I think it's moronic that you have to be running IE in order to access their website but that's a whole nutha whine session all on it's own! lol. Hi Kelly !No it's not so moronic. It's moronic that you have to use 32 bit windows to do it... I wanted to log into their site first problem was because Firefox (I have IE installed I just don't use it) and second because I am using 64bit version of windows... Now that is morronic...He he...Andy. I definately do! I use CalorieKing's PDA software to look up foods I'm eating punch them into my Minimed 715 and then download and tweak my settings with the Solutions software. My old endo used to love when I'd show up with all the graphs and info... it'll be interesting to see how a new one will react as I'll soon be heading to my first endo appointment since I moved for school.. I use HanDBase for Palm to track sugars and I can't stand the UltraSmart software.What I would like to see is a meter with bluetooth and client software for Windows Mobile/S60/Palm/iPhone that will let me e-mail results upload to a server and to Twitter/Jaiku individual sugars and other readings.. I'm currently using a UltraSmart with the OneTouch management software but I also use HandDBase for Palm to track sugars.Since I work for AT&T and I change phones constantly I would really like someone to come up with:1. a Bluetooth version of the UltraSmart. I'd pay more for the meter if it had Bluetooth.2. Client software for Windows Mobile iPhone PalmOS and S60Until that happens I would like a online database that works on mobile browsers. That would make it a lot easier to add data anywhere.. Hi everyoneI have a question. What is up with the crappy displays on our pumps?Gees how come my cell phone has a better display than any of the pumps?It is a battery drain issue? Even my OmniPod PDA has a display like the old original Palm Pilots use to have. Since a lot of us no longer have the best eye sight you would think that maybe a organic LED color display would be nice. I know that the Animas 2020 has one but it's menu functionality is terrible. That's another thing who designs the menu flows on some of these pumps. Both the displays and the menus functions are completely old design. Could you imagine how many iPhones would be sold if it used the Animas 2020 menu system. I am a old mainframe programmer and if I had put out a system for the user that the menus worked like some of these pump menus I would be fired! I just think that maybe the pump companies should get more up to date on these issues. Does anyone else have an opinion on this? Am I being to picky here? Anyway just my two cents for what's it worth.Thanks for listening to me . Hi Peter !I totally understand you... If I made that crappy looking things I would be fired also... And if you take a look at protocols (for PC communication) that our meters use... disaster. I won't even start with pump protocols.... I have seen that of Minimed... Disaster...No you are not picky... It's just that we technical people are a little bit more... sensitive on equipment we carry around...Andy. Hi everybody !I just have one short question for you all... Has someone of you tried to run Sidiary on their PDA (either Palm or PocketPC version). I have just started using it because I couldn't find any other software that would help with carb counting AND also diabetes management... If you haven't tried and want to download it on www.sinovo.net it's free for 30 days (version 5) version 4 was free...I tried Calorie King but version for PocketPC is not that good...Andy. So you got this Solutions Pumps and Meter program? I got this one when I bought cable... I will start adding Pump support for software I work on in few weeks (probably). If you can contact me via PM (personal message) we could talk more and you can give me few ideas?Andy. So has anyone tried the Track 3 ? I input my BG and med and insulin and it is like a mini diary. Later I download it to my computer and print out all the graphs for my endo and he loves it. One other thing that was sweet it also keeps track of carbs and does have a food diary..www.coheso.com. Yes I am glad to know I'm not the only \"diageek\".I got a pump one month after diagnosis because there was no way I was going to do this manually if there was a computer that could help. I used to have a palm and use calorie king but I stopped after it died.I just got the cgms and switched from flash to ultrasmart (and really HATE how much MORE blood I have to offer the meter gods to get a stinkin' number!) and can't find a piece of software I like to anyalize all this new data. Since I have the cgms the Carelink site makes much more sense now but I don't really like how they show fingerstick data. The onetouch software could have been made by a 16 year old in beginner's programming class.Have any of you seen sugarstats.com? It's web based (but who's going to blackmail me for my numbers????) but I love the u.i. I just can't put in all the data I want in there. But it's a good start!\n",
      "Hello fellow geeks!We're looking for glucose meter export file so we can provide a wider-range of support for glucose meters in SugarStats.com .At the moment we only have support for OneTouch meters but if you'd like your meter supported the easiest way to help is to send us the export file created by the management software that comes with your meter.I figure if there is a group that actually uses the software that comes with their meters it is this one Each one will be different unfortunately but at the very least we hope most of them support .XML or .CSV exports of your glucose data just like the OneTouch Diabetes Management Software 2.3+ does.We're looking especially for export files from:Each meter's software should have an export feature.If you'd like to help out simply shoot us a mail with the file attached to: support@sugarstats.comYour data will be kept private. Thanks for your help!. What about support for Glucose One users? I'm addicted to my Palm Treo and with Glucose One I am able to just beam the readings to my Doctors!. Hi !Did you get any \"exports\" so far? I am also developer of diabetes management software and we have come across same problem as you. No company wishes to disclose anything. I talked to several of them and so far only ascensia has send me protocols. If you wish I will \"trade\" it for what you have... but be prepared the document is really long...Take care.Andy. AndyI am really glad you are doing this. I wondered if the $trip companies were just being lazy or if anyone had experience with them indicating they were actually obstructing progress to maintain profit.I only have a Mac at this point. I used the One Touch software with the Ultra Smart but the monitor and software were a little bulky and unwieldy.Maybe I'm picky but I am not sure why it has diabetes tech has to lag so far behind everything else.. Hi Rob !They are obstructing progress. But I don't really know if they maintain profit... by doing this...I mean if I were meter company I would wish that every software around would support my meter so that many people would want to buy it by saying... \"gee this meter is supported everywhere... I could use any diabetes software I want. I will buy that...\"But it looks that this company is saying... \"I will keep how I communicate to my-self even though my protocol is not worth anything just so that diabetes users have to use my software that is totally outdated...\"We lag behind everyone because we are really limited with what companies give us... there is virtually no support for anything out there. Each meter/pump company plays in it own little play-garden and we the users are paying for it... I must say I have contacted about 10 meter companies and 4 pumps companies (one of them is refusing to receive mails from customers so I couldn't contact 5). Out of 4 pump companies one said no to giving protocols 3 I haven't heard from... On meter front is even worse. From 10 I got 3 replies 1 said no and 2 are for sharing. I am already implementing Ascensia/Bayer protocols they will be available in release of software planned for end of 2008 and I got also contact from Lifescan few days ago and they started cooperating I will be getting all protocols by September (I got 75% of them already remaining 25% till September) when I am starting with implementation of Lifescan meters support...Rob would you be willing to test my diabetes software on Mac? 1st public release is now planned for June so if you could contact me privately I can supply you with somewhat workable version. I will need to make few adjustments for Mac but it shouldn't take a lot of your time...Take careAndy. Way back when I first started with the original Freestyle Therasense made the APIs available directly to any developer. We were not at that interest level or that technical level at the time. What you may want to do there is see if you can find anyone who's been using Freestyle for hmm I'd guesstimate four years or longer who downloaded the APIs.. This might be a problem... I don't know anybody who even uses Freestyle... They are not sold where I live... I will probably write entry here on tudiabetes.com maybe someone has it...Andy. Hi !For Roche:For getting data from all Roche devices (pumps too) you need to use their own device called Accu-Chek Smart Pix. It is USB Mass storage device with HTML controls (you control it with web page) they also have export (it's automatic) in their xml. Contact company and they will help you.For Freestyle:I found free application called Glucose Meter Downloader. It startup project (it's simple framework) for getting meter data but they only have FreeStyle for now. I think they started SweetSpot project out of it...http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/04/17/2161924.aspxAndy. After a longer delay than I wanted I started loading the software for the meters I've been testing out in my blog. The Advocate Duo (which for multiple reasons I heartily disrecommend as a meter) will only print out the results from the current session and will not allow for aggregated readings.The Wavesense Keynote exports really basic information in both .pdf and .csv formats.I'm still in the process of loading the One Touch software at which point I will have three different meters to look at and correlate.\n",
      "I sniffed the data coming back from the pump. I noticed that reading is done by polling bytes while writing is done all at once. Also I noticed hex 55 seems to be a sort of EOF type value. I looked up 0x55 in an ASCII table and its uppercase U. Not very useful. I think we can do some data manipulation to see more. I think we should consider hex to ASCII and hex to decimal. After that we should investigate if the numbers are being sent back in some sort of floating point binary encoding. Also it seems writing 02 is a repeated action. Maybe its one of the more important commands? I can't believe you guys haven't started this project yet! Then we decode the transmitter.9124-pump_read.LOG (953 KB). Hmmm very interesting stuff. Why would they have so many EOF commands in a row? 0x55 has to be the most widly used command on there. Also what program did you use to pull this data?GJ though! This is really pretty neat. portmon. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/portmon.mspxlink to dl: http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/PortMon.zipI did write an app to get the data from an accu check compact meter once. very similar file.. This sucks. BD has asshats as engineers.. Thanks for the log Jack. I do a little work with hex coding /decoding of radio transmission formats. This could be fun. I will let you know what find. The 055 might be some sort of heartbeat. I've got an email address for a local guy who did programming for Medtronic Minimed pumps. I could get brave and ask him what he would about this subject. I suspect that as a contractor he is obligated to say nothing.. Steve Are you going to ask him about the sensor transmitter? That is what I am really interested in working on. Find out the protocol. We know the frequency. What kind of receiver if the transmitter is bi-directionaletc. I think he can tell you general things. Do you think that this is the kind of receiver we would need?http://www.laipac.com/easy_916f_eng.htm. Did you talk the contractor guy. He will spill the beans. It's not like it is a big deal.. I'm an AMX programmer so integrating with different devices via RS232 is something I do daily. I just got the pump (722 though) a couple of weeks ago and I'm more interested in hacking the thing to allow more than a 25.0u bolus. But - I also sniffed it out with PortMon and got a slightly different write / read log. I don't have it with me so I can't quite compare line for line - but it is just a little different. Anyway . . .By just knowing how serial devices talk there needs to be some kind of patern rhyme and reason such as:1) by checksums (and/or) [side note: I think the 0x55 could be some kind of checksum coupled with other bytes]2) some kind of header / footerI haven't run across a device yet (and most likely won't) that doesn't have one of those - loosely said - requirements. Converting the hex to ASCII won't do much (ASCII is just something that we humans can read); converting it to binary could help.I did notice a few more things:1) The \"longer\" write commands are 13 bytes in length (ex. lines 164280396etc.) with the exception of 7 write commands totally 109 in length. (Still a bit confused by that.)2) After those \"longer\" write commands a {0x550x33} is the response followed by a {0x02} write then the response {0xE10x6B0x55} followed by {0x08} at which point I believe the data is recieved containing the checksum to say it's \"finished\" with that \"request\".A few things to keep in mind: 0x02 is STX (start of text); it appears every data request response starts off with {0xA90x6D0x230x660x6D0x34} - which appears to be the header and ends with what I'm guessing is the checksum.Anyway I'm probably just stating the obvious and things already known but I thought I'd make this a \"public record\" now.. Just an addition to my previous posting:1) Responses from a 13-byte command are always 107-bytes in length. Coupling that with the information from my previous post the last 101-bytes are probably the data and the checksum. The last three bytes of the response are always different. I can't quite find the correlation between the question and the answer - meaning I can't find where the checksum is and/or how it is determined.Anyway again - stuff that can be found by just studying the log. I'll be heading home tomorrow so I can check out my pump log and compare my findings. This is of course all just my interpretation of the log and I may be very wrong in my conclusions. That said anyone want to take a stab at verifying or discounting my logic and train of thought with this whole thing?. Very cool. Thanks for investigating. we should write a program to send the log back to the pump. We would convert it from hex to a byte array and then send it to the pump. We may break the pump but I guess that's what warranties are for! I would love to get the protocol for the transmitter.. I'm starting to wonder if this is a moot point since the Paradigm is going to be replaced by a Lifescan meter next year (probably the OneTouch Ultra.) The protocol for that is much easier (that's if they don't change much of it.). So you are saying the meter the pump uses will be replaced? Wonder why?. Yes - Minimed will be using a model of the One Touch series from Lifescan in Spring. I didn't mean it will be replaced you'll just have another option so I guess it's not completely pointless. I just prefer the OneTouch over this BD piece of junk.Article: http://www.minimed.com/products/insulinpumps/components/meter_announcement.htmlThe piece that sticks into the meter of the USB cable broke a few weeks ago that's why I haven't been able to play with my meter & pump.. Ooops - silly me. I have no idea what I was thinking. The protocol between the meter (whatever the meter) and the pump would need to be the same (unless Minimed is going to update our pumps by having the firmware/software shot across through thin air via the meter - not a good idea IMO.)But to re-re-clarify what I meant . . . the protocol between the meter and the PC will most likely change however the protocol between the meter and the pump won't. If my speculations are true then we'll be able to hack the meter / pump in no time. The OneTouch protocol is readily available but I'm sure there will be a few extra commands for the pump in the meter. Gosh I can't wait!!. Hi !Has somebody here tried to write software to read pump data? Or maybe tried to \"hack\" software that Minimed has written (java classes used on CareLInk web site)?Andy\n",
      "So my computer was scanning today and it found 4 trojan horse generators in some set up files.what the heck is this and what to i have to do?. SarahI just saw this message. If your computer is 2 or 3 years old I'd download the free full version of Spyware Doctor from Google Pack http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html?hl=en&gl=us and run it. It will eliminate a lot of spyware/trojans.If your computer is older you can download Spybot Search and Destroy. http://www.safer-networking.org/ It can also get rid of a lot of trojans.The age of the computer matters because Spyware Doctor and the whole Google pack thing can really hog up resources on an older computer.Trojans are programs that got downloaded into your computer when you visited a site that was hijacked or run by evildoers. These programs can make your computer send out information to the software writers or have it send out spam or any number of things you don't want to do.If you aren't running the Firefox browser http://www.mozilla.org switching to Firefox can help prevent trojans from loading onto your computer. it's very similar to Internet Explorer except much more secure and has some nice added features.There are a couple bits of nastyware that have figured out how to invade even Firefox though. Spyware doctor loads something called Teatimer which monitors your computer for suspicious behavior--like attempts to change your registry. I'm not 100% sure how effective it is but it might help.. Are you running any Anti-Virus packages on the system ? If so be sure to do a full system scan and make sure the software is configured to quarantine and delete the infected files.if you aren't running anti-virus... Get one ASAP.Jeff\n",
      "Not only has Health Canada approved the Dexcom G5 today but they have approved it for \"non-adjunctive\" use meaning as a fingerstick replacement.LinkI wonder if this will improve our ability to get CGM costs covered under insurance plans?. Hooray!!!  . Yay for Jen and all of you Canucks with D! . I'm happy for all the people w/D in Canada. Since the US FDA expert panel approved the Dexcom CGM for insulin dosing I'm hoping the larger FDA will approve it soon. This should pave the way for Medicare CGM coverage. Congrats to Health Canada for making a good decision!. Does that mean insurance companies could stop covering test strips?. Does that mean insurance companies could stop covering test strips?I don't think so but I understand your thinking. Dexcom in Europe was approved for making treatment decisions but there are still some needed fingersticks.  The Dex must be calibrated 2x/day and Dexcom instructs patients in Europe to confirm with a fingerstick if their symptoms are at odds with the CGM number.Your fear is well-founded and we as a community must keep a close watch on this. I use a CGM and still fingesrtick several times every day. The CGM accuracy and precision is not perfect.. Keep in mind that this only means the G5 is available it doesn't mean that government or private insurance will cover it. Since test strips are still much cheaper I doubt the government will be covering CGMs anytime soon (though this varies by province and I can only speak for BC). My insurance is currently \"evaluating\" whether to cover CGMs so I have my fingers crossed. But since 99% of Canadians who use CGMs pay for the cost themselves and since the G5 is inherently more expensive than the G4 I don't think many will be upgrading (I won't be unless insurance covers it). I'm hopeful that the ability to dose will help with coverage but I think that insurance companies and especially the government go off of what studies show so it may not change anything. (In BC insulin analogues aren't 100% covered because studies have shown they have no advantage over older insulins and test strip coverage for people who don't use insulin has been capped at 200/year because studies show no benefits to more testing for people not using insulin...). HOORAY!  With the G5 bluetooth transmitter now available I don't have to carry around my xDrip Bridge anymore to view my BG on an android phone!I have been using a DEXCOM G4 (no share) for about 2 months now. I am feeling ok about not waiting for the Health Canada decision about the G5 because the last two months with the G4 have been awesome from a diabetes perspective. Like Jen I live in BC and there is no coverage through the provincial drug plan but I am \"lucky\" enough my private insurance plan that my employer offers covers all the CGM costs (transmitters and sensors). Hopefully I can just start using the G5 transmitters when my current G4 transmitter battery dies.In related news - I got my cheap and cheerful Pebble watch last week (yes it is awesome)... Too bad Dexcom doesn't have all the features in xDrip+ oh well maybe one day.... Hooray for Canada. Maybe we will wise up in the states someday.\n",
      "Are any of you Geekabetics gamers? If so let us all know what kind of gamer (PC Platforms like Xbox or Play Station Board) and if so which games you play or plan on playing (W.O.W. Counterstrike Mario Strikers Halo).I would love to \"frag\" with you if you do so lemme know!I am a PC gamer mostly playing LOTRO and Counter Strike Source. I am just about to start playing Team Fortress 2 so that will be my new addiction. I also have a Wii and would love some Wii friends!. I just started playing TF2 pretty steady. I finished up Zelda: twilight princess (amazing game btw) so this is a good change. Buy the preorder orange box and get to it!Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/id/godofcheese. I'm not much of a gamer (though I enjoy a few online games here & there - currently addicted to Desktop Tower Defence). I just wanted to say that Geekabetic is a COOL word! Love it . I like to make up words like that. I often refer to myself as Ninjabetic since it takes a Ninja to live with Diabetes!. Hey DanWe turned Zelda into a family event... My son raqn the wiimote I looked for clues on the screen while my wife worked the Cheats book! We had a blast! Great game!. Well... I've got a PS2 and Wii as well as my Nintendo DS.I'm generally too busy to get too into games but I love the Wii Sports game and can't wait for the coming Star Wars game that will turn the Wiimote into a light sabre.My favorite game is Burnout on both the PS2 & DS... There is something very theraputic about crashing your car and doing maximum damage!. I play on pretty much everything - PC console (Wii/360) handheld etc. I'm currently rocking on the Orange Box (just beat Portal last night - amazing game!) and I have a mile-high stack of other games I need to get to when work stops being so busy.If anyone wants to add me on Xbox Live my tag is NoukonZenshin.. Remember: if the weighted companion cube talks to you don't take its advice.. Portal = one of the best games I have ever played!I actually beat it twice because it was so sweet I had to play it again!I <3 the song. LOL. I'm mainly a PC Gamer. I know it's old school but I still play Diablo II pretty regularly. I never really got into FPS I like strategy and RPGs.. I'm a PC gamer. Husband and I try to avoid the console play systems because we are bad enough with the PC games. We both prefer MMORPGs but aren't currently playing any. I plan to go back to WoW in the next couple of weeks though.. Used to be a heavy gamer. PC titles mostly. I always suspected that once the game deck avalanche started I would never be heard from again. I've been taking a break for some time but I'm going to be building a new gaming rig soon and I expect I will be spending a lot of time playing whatever the latest Call Of Duty or Medal of Honor title is.In my fooling around time I've become addicted to this great Flash game called ChopRaider.. Hi there I mostly play PC games the main one I play is ArmACheers. I didn't realise that anyone else actually played ArmA. While I am not good at all I have a blast playing that game. Currently I am eagerly awaiting OF2 due out later this year.. Speaking of addicting Flash games - anyone ever tried Canyon Defender? I was on a business trip with nothing to do in my hotel room and spent HOURS playing it that week. The last map is really hard!. Yep been playing ArmA for ages now.. where I play we have planned coop nights where everyone follows CoC has tasks etc to complete mission etc.. ArmA 2 is in the making. hard core....I work in the industry. I was at Midway for nearly 5 years now I am at Turbine.Oddly enough I do not have any consoles and stopped playing MMO's before the first expansion for Ultima came out. CounterStrike is a totally different story Ditto for Red Orchestra. 8^) But my main thing is the Il2 series from Maddox Games. I cannot fly a plane in real life and even if I could I would not get to practice carrier traps in a Corsair or spend an evening shooting down bad guys with squad mates.Not many games can bring to to heart pounding sweating and nearly shaking with a mixture of fear and excitement like Il2 can.There are lots of fan made videos out thereThis one is really goodhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9wBwLRbvBkthis one is not quite as well made but I am still pretty happy with having made it.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvzEUHRjtX0Ivan!. IL2 is the best combat flight sim around that Ive played. its great when using a trackIR as well Great videos as wellCheers. I'm a gamer by all means. Currently i'm playing on portables and consoles after a long run of PC/Mac Gaming with World of Warcraft.Also playing a little EverQuest II while my account is re-activated for free.I also enjoy the occasionally FPS.I highly recommend http://noobtoob.com for a gaming podcast.. Just got a Wii. Really enjoying that so far. Only got the basic games that come with the system (like bowling the best of those) the Wii Play games and Mario Kart. Son has bought another game that I've not tried yet. Mario Kart is fun. Any suggestions on other Wii games for a 40 something fellow to play?. boom blocks. As long as you dont mind all kinds of cheesy dialog and kidish looking stuff on the screen it is amazing. The gameplay goes from SUPER easy to dificult enough that my friends who are engineers are doing stress analasis on the levels to figure out the best plan.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Blox. Sounds like fun. Will see if I can find a copy of that one.. I have been a gamer for years even though I did just get a Wii. Started out with a don't everybody laugh too loud at this Magnavox Odyssey system. When my son was about 4 or 5 we got a Playstation actually still have it but never use it we upgraded to a PS2. Played numerous computer games Space Quest series Kings Quest series Tiger Woods Golf all sorts of baseball sim games as well as Sims SimCity etc. Was in college when a lot of the video games really gained popularity in arcades. Played all sorts of those.First love was always pinball machines though. Always had a blast playing them still play them when I can find them. A museum not too far from where I live had an exhibition of pinball machines few years ago. Spent all afternoon looking at the machines and playing them FOR FREE!!! Wonderful afternoon. Wish they would do it again.. I enjoy an evening of Halo. You can find my once in awhile in a heavey weapon room as PowerUnit. You may wish you didn't \n",
      "How come I can link my IPhone to my GPS in my car with bluetooth but nobody has made a blood glucose meter with bluetooth so it can easily talk to computers or a pump? Most meters don't even use USB to talk to computers...are these companies just idiots or just low tech?. I wonder if the new wavesense bluetooh meter will be able to????. I've heard mention that the power requiremments for Bluetooth make a Bluetooth-enabled meter impractical.Another issue with Bluetooth is legal: keeping medical data private and secure over radio channels.A number of meters do use USB cables; others use serial-to-USB connectors along with serial cables. Sometimes you need to search third-parties and/or further afield to find the appropriate USB cable.I did some meter reviews earlier this year and have USB cables for the following meters:Note that each meter company has a proprietary interface or set of data transmitted across the connection so the Advocate cable and software doesn't work with the Freestyle monitors or vice-versa. The meter companies tell me the proprietary set-ups are required to maintain privacy of medical information.. It's most likely a security issue. Bluetooth signals can be intercepted and modified and distance is not a limiting factor ( http://www.hacknmod.com/hack/extend-bluetooth-to-over-a-mile/). I am not so concerned with someone stealing my contact list but I would not want them interfering with the communications between my pump and meter.. TaiDoc is a major blood glucose monitoring manufacturer in Asia.http://www.taidoc.com/pclink-software.htmlThey have a bluetooth-enabled meter. I think cost of the bluetooth is more of the issue than the actual security. A bluetooth connection requires you to enter a password that is used to encrypt the connection.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Security\n",

      "Hi !I am one of developers of GNU Gluco Control diabetes management software. First public release will be out in few weeks and I would need some people to test it out and tell me what they think needs to be added. I have quite a lot ideas myself (and I am adding them slowly) but I need a different perspective... So if some of you are willing to test-drive this software I would be very thankful... First public version is 0.3 and it will be just a \"preview\" version... I am still having some issues with database (I am adding functionality and changing tables quite frequently) and until there is a DatabaseTool (we support almost all databases that can be used via JDBC) and export/import tool all version will be just preview...Please let me know if you are interested... I will make a alpha version available in few days...Andy. Andy I went to the GCC site a few days ago and the available d/l was 0.2.9.7 and the nutritional database was SR18. I couldn't get too far with what I'm presuming is an alpha (or pre-alpha) version -- I didn't realize it was a \"preview only\".The other question I have is why SR 18? I recently dl'd SR20 from the USDA site which appears to be a more recent version. Is SR18 more accurate? (SR20 has a lot of entries that don't make sense (i.e. a 1-oz serving of cheese having roughly 1800 calories).). Hi !Actually you can use whatever version you want.... I have tested with SR-18 and also with SR-20. Import works for both of them...I am affraid to say that release was postponed for another month... If everything was ok 0.3 should be out today but I got swamped with work so I had to postpone it...I can get you a newer test version if you wish to test it... before it comes officially out...Andy. I saw the delay note yesterday on the project news (it gave me an RSS option; I took it). I haven't figured out how the nutritional database imports into the program... all I really got was a basic interface with no real user input other than just clicking on the tabs. (Again I understand it's still in alpha development.) Not sure if I'm missing something.... Mhm... It should be working at least some... You should be able to add data (personal data) without problem. Version 0.2.9.7 doesn't work with nutrition db. it can display entries but that is all... Only the newst version has this new functionality... I am still fixing calculating of data but it will be done soon... You can test my (test) version which I use for my diabetes management...That version is really alpha and a lot of functionality is not there...Andy. OK I went through it again was able to put in my name my preferred units and edit the \"insulin type\" information. Most of the tabs mentioned in what version they are expected to be active. I only have one datapoint in there right now so I haven't tried doing any graphing. BTW what is \"Stock\" under the Medical tab?. Hi !In this version there is not much done but my current is quite functional...Stocks is everything you have at home (it was meant for medical stuff) you know insulin. This helps you track what you have at home and what you need to get from doctor on your next visit...Andy. Yes I am very interested in Testing the software!what platform is it written for?. It's in java so it should theoretically work everywhere.... About 25 days till 1st public release (intended for users)....Andy. Ok. It has taken much more time than expected... but finally realase is here.Take a look at web site:http://ggc.sourceforge.net/Andy\n",
      "Anyone know of any apps being developed for the iPhone? I just switched from a Treo 650 and am missing my CalorieKing carb database among other things.I know with the SDK release that we are likely to see some cool things in June but am wondering if anyone has learned about any diabetes-specific apps.. Nothing here yet that I know of but I was just thinking the same thing. I made the exact same switch a little over a month ago. Really happy with the iPhone so far. Wonder if the guys at SugarStats.com are looking at the iPhone?. nan. hi id like to see an easy ....way to record blood sugar numbers ....that would input date... time automaticly ....maybe a list of foods /quantitys as checklist......user input on main computer...alarms to remind you to test......way to mail results to doctor. thanks mark!. Hi !I am little more demanding... I would like to have time(date) BG insulin OH (with food database at least USDA one and if there would be user_db option that would be nice (changeablke by user). PC application to add to database and to have data stored on computer as well as iPhone.... Actually I am looking for such application for my PocketPC too...Andy. nan. Hey allThis app was released for the iPhone on July 17th 2008:Glucose-Charter(tm) v1.0.There are 10 reviews at this point giving it 4 out of 5 stars. It cost 4.99. I haven't downloaded it yet although I'm on the verge. Has anyone tried it yet?Apparently there are a few bugs including not having a place to enter insulin amount or the ability to adjust time/date stamps.I am a mac user and I just haven't found any program that will really work for me and my life style. I spend quite a few minutes every few days writing everything down by hand slowly scrolling back through my histories. It sucks actually. I use a Minimed paradigm 522 pump.In response to Adam's question - there needs to be a place for notes (stress exercise illness) and it would be cool to have a pattern/graph option.:DH. http://martoon.com/diamedic/another app log. i have no opinion of it as i've not used it yet.. Hi allJust wanted to let you know I've developed an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch.Islet 2.0 allows entry of glucose insulin food and exercise data. Backdating is possible. You can email comma-separated lists to export the data. Graph all types of data - view high average and low data on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis. Export full-size graphs. $2.99 on the App Store - http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=294770449&mt=8I am actively developing this app still and would love to hear some feedback! You can find more information and screenshots here: http://www.iabetics.comThanks-Mike. There are two or three applications available for the iPhone/iPod Touch. I reviewed one of them here: http://www.honeysweet.us/2009/02/14/a-review-of-the-diabetes-log-itunes-app/There is also GlucoseBuddy islet and diabetes pilot. I hope to be reviewing them all soon.. While not strictly a diabetes apps Dietician can be useful for those looking to manage their diet:http://www.appletell.com/apple/comment/appletell-reviews-dietician-for-iphone-ipod-touch/. I'm very excited to hear about these applications using the IPhone (and possibly other mobile devices.) Has any thought about how to integrate these apps with tudiabetes.com where others can help monitor give advice and support others? And possibly how to link this with the healthcare team (Physicians (GP and Endos) Nurse Diabetes Educators Dietitians etc)?Thank you!Steve. I thought this was a great idea at first considering I always have my iPhone with me but after downloading and trying to use a couple (Glucose bud and Glucose) I realized that the last thing I wanted to do after pricking my finger was leave a giant blood smear across the face of my iPhone. So I went back to the low tech route. Unfortunately for me I'm a bleeder . Exactly!! A carelink system for the iPhone. (As it is carelink - on the minimed web page- only works on flippin PC's...). According to what I understand there are iPhone/iTouch apps being produced right now where your glucose readings will transfer over the air via a sensor gateway. For more on this check out this blog post from Diabetic Cookbook Blog.. Diabetes pilot works great in all areas - takes a little bit to get customized tho. Once done it's the best one out there so far.. How about an App that keeps all the prescription #'s and reminds you when to refill them!!!!! Also that keeps track of how many refills you have left.?? Any thoughts??. I have Diabetes Pilot on my HTC winmo but find inputting everything manually a drag. Would really love to see more integration with meters and manufacturers opening it up a bit more.I'd also love to have something that uses the GPS in my phone to track exercise. At the moment for my cycling i use Garmin .gpx files which i upload to trailguru.com and that gives me a calories burned graphs and stuff.I think I may get rid of my HTC and go the iPhone way - seems like that's where all the good apps are now .... Amen!. here's a carb counter for the iphone : http://www.myt1life.com/. I am starting to look now. Any new insight into cool / functional apps? Also anyone know if there is any integration with the Paradigm 722 or the Meter?. I do not know of any integration directly with the meter or 722 pump aside from the carelink site - but GlucoseSurfer on the web can import the csv files exported from the carelink site as well as the text files of food/activity/etc I create in Glucose Buddy on my ipod touch - that way I have a single database and don't have to reimport the glucose readings into glucose buddy as all of that data is now in the csv file from the pump. Still trying to get my not particularly tech savvy CDE to appreciate all this effort!. If we look at Mendosa.com we can quickly learn about almost everything that has been designed for diabetics in terms of record-keeping and testing. My beef is that they all seem to be looking in the same way and are generally variations on the same theme. We need to zoom out quite a bit and begin asking a whole different set of questions and design something that truly makes us partners with our health care team. I want to examine my diabetes in a context that sees me as a whole patient. So much attention on blood glucose readings carb and calorie counts and insulin/meds seems to me to be like everybody's running around the same flag pole. There are hundreds of existing applications to do this one faster or snazzier but essentially the same old same old.The SDK will integrate these much more in two or three years especially if we begin designing it now. We need to adapt other hardware so our bg meters plug right into the iPad. And so does our BP cuff and our scales. And our A1c. We can touch screen our dosages but I still refuse to turn every meal into a science experiment when I've matched most other's results in terms of weight loss and lowering A1c by simply listing what I always put into my mouth. Dragon will type that in already on my iPhone. We can then get an integrated printout to dazzle ourselves email them to our providers and use database management to compile 7 day 14 day monthly quarterly histories and trends.I am working with both Type 1 and Type 2 in metro Twin Cities of Minnesota on these issues so we can arrive at a system that works better for a whole bunch of us. If we consider ourselves a Beta site and work together on these things we can benefit a whole group of people down the road. That's our strength IMHO! Miigwetch!. geek in training here. I found 2 apps to be helpful. Wishing for CalorieKing app in the mean time found CarbsControl $1.99 Coheso Inc to be a workable sub.Another free app with video content courtesy of dLife is WaveSense Diabetes Manager. Fairly simple to use to record gluose carbs and insulin data in one place. Includes space for note.Tried several bb apps and was very disappointed. The iphone/itouch apps are much nicer and easier to use.-C. This looks pretty interesting:http://ibgstar.com/web/ibgstarNot calorie software but might make BG logging a bit better.. For Carb counting values I use Nutrition Menu which costs .99 but is so worth it. Has values for a lot of restaurants as well as values for other food items. It's been handy for times when I bring my lunch but forget the carb values. It also has features that track your weight & activity as well. I also found an App called GluCoMo which has a really nice looking interface but so far it dosen't use mmol/L so I havn't used it. I sent an email to them so hopefully they will push out an update soon (it can use metric for height & weight so I don't know why they didn't have it as an option for Blood Glucose).I just \"dusted off\" Glucose Buddy and have started using it again. I don't love it but it's been the best so far in my opinion.. I found that glucose buddy (search the itunes store for it its free) works pretty well for trending. don't think it reads meters but if you track things with teh app it will help you trend things. http://www.glucosebuddy.com/ is thier website and its free (my favorite kind of app). Why does your \"sweetspot\" website go to a \".dm\"? Firefox tells me that the cert for that site is for the .com only.. and only then on XP not \"7\".. nan. I use a app called rxremindme its a great reminder program for taking your meds and insulin. the app gives a running total of how much insulin is left in your pen and you can set up 'as needed' doses for adjustments of insulin etc.. The Calorie King app is available for iPhone now so grab that if you haven't already.I'm also a fan of Ayogo's Diabesties. Admittedly I work there but it's very easy to use connects you with friends and is free.Ayogo is also working on some apps for kids. :)Cheers Adrian\n",
      "Is there an rss aggregator for diabetes related blogs? (using Planetmaybe?). I use google reader. Its search makes it easy to find diabetes related bogs and sites.RandyC. I don't think this is an aggregator but it will show you new postings for a huge number of diabetes blogs including most of the ones I've found worth tracking.http://www.diabetesdaily.com/news/headlines/.

      "Hi allI want it all! I want to be able to combine data from my pump dexcom glucose meters polar heart rate monitor and/or gps training devices cycling power meters (if I can ever afford to buy one) and food intake into one device or program. I would love to be able to see all of this displayed in some logical graph. It would be so much easier for me to make some conclusions about what is working and what is not working in my training. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?. I think that's the Holy Grail we're all looking for... Right now I'm using the web-baesd Polar Personal Trainer to automatically log data uploaded from my F6 HRM. The post-workout data it gives me is limited to 12 stored files including start time duration HR (average) HR (max) and calories burned (based exclusively on cardiovascular effort). If I look at the most recent file before my next workout I can manually capture the \"Own Zone\" heart rate levels for that workout. Polar Personal Trainer allows me to add in the exercise activity and the mileage manually.I believe some of their more advanced HRMs come with software that can run directly on your PC. That could conceivably give you an export data file -- and more information than I can get off the Polar F6.My biggest annoyance with HRMs is that they don't capture a complete time record of a workout so it's hard to record what levels of exertion and what levels of exhaustion cause what changes in heart-rate (this would also be useful to coordinate with a CGM to determine performance versus blood-glucose level). My guess is that we'd need to borrow Holter Monitors for that sort of information Most diet-management web sites allow you to enter exercise in some form or another -- probably not in the detail you're looking for. A lot of folk here like Calorie King for diet management. I've tried out FitDay but I'm not fond of its limitations in terms of serving size. Nutrition Data is much better for that but appears to be based on something less exhaustive than the USDA's NAL database. The Daily Plate covers food general time of consumption and exercise with a lot of brand-name information and the ability to add more foods to the general database. I do end up having to use a calculator to fraction out servings correctly.Sweet Spot -- started by Adam Greene of this community -- appears as if it should time-coordinate blood glucose with food and exercise. I haven't tried this system yet so I don't know the how detailed the inputs are or could be. Andy Rozman of this community is working on a system that will interface blood glucose monitor automatic uploads with the full NAL nutrition database -- the system is still pre-alpha right now.The issues that these developers are facing are primarily that the various manufacturers have proprietary serial infrared and/or USB interfaces and often proprietary output formats. Add to that multiple types of information and the need for a foods database...The bottom line is people are working on this issue but it's going to take some time before we have something usable. Meanwhile you might be best off setting up an Excel workbook and manually setting up the charts you want.... Hi !Andy here.\"My\" project was now released so you can try it out but at this time you will be disappointed if you are waiting for Dexcom or any extended pump/meter support. We are still working on supporting as many devices as possible but everything takes time especially when device companies are not working with us but against us... I got some support from meter companies (big ones) but pump companies and CGM companies don't give any support. We have USDA food database in program you can make your own foods databases (meals too)... so try it out.Take a look at web site:http://ggc.sourceforge.net/Andy. invent one and become rich\n",

      "OK geeks!I have a new project that needs a taker.Skills required:* Basic web design* Intermediate HTML knowledgeHere's the scoop:We have dozens of groups in the Groups section that could help connect people living in different regions. However the groups themselves are not easy to find.The idea is to display a clickable map that members could hover over and click in order to either navigate a level down (for instance if there's a group of folks in LA and one in the Bay Area they both would be linked to from the West Coast map).The trick is to do this using maps (geographical maps) and combining them with HTML imagemaps (clickable images where different portions of the image link to different pages.I need help with putting together the project from end to end. The deliverable would be the different pieces of code that we could paste in static pages to be linked (ultimately linking to the appropriate Group pages). The main static page would be linked from a visible place in the home page.Obviously there would be visible credit displayed for whoever helps with this. We cannot offer any pay but we can include a link back to your web site or portfolio if you so want to.Are there any takers?. I can contribute to this with a map of the US and the image maps behind it.Let me confirm that you're looking for some HTML code than can be placed in a web page.Hey did you vote today? . Would a mashup with Google Maps be suitable?. I wish I had the time . . . . then again I haven't coded an image map in probably 10 years.. One last question. Could someone assemble a list of groups by US Location?. I can help with this most definitely. It's relatively easy image-mapping actually. All one would need are the maps and the locations they're supposed to link to and I'd be able to take care of the rest.. I am working on something similar for iPump (click on states to who we have helped and where our donors are from) and am otherwise incredibly swamped. But if you get no one else to help when I am done with my own mapping project perhaps I can help some.. How about this example?I used the map from Wikipedia. I think Creative Commons allows this though we should give attribution.I can't guarantee that I picked the right group in each case I'd welcome corrections.. OMG Bernard!!! This is amazing!!!What do you suggest we do to be inclusive with regards to Canada UK Australia etc.?Maybe we can have a world map?. I think that a world map that might lead to maps for continents (or directly to groups) would work.I can see if I can put that together over the next few days. Let me know if you'd like the source.. Also the longest part of this work was getting a list of all the groups.Can someone collect a list of all geographical groups for me? That will really speed things up.. I will get it to you.. http://tudiabetes.com/group/canadahttp://tudiabetes.com/group/unitedkingdomhttp://tudiabetes.com/group/irishdiabeticshttp://tudiabetes.com/group/europemainlandhttp://tudiabetes.com/group/mediterraneandiabeteshttp://tudiabetes.com/group/newzealandaustraliahttp://tudiabetes.com/group/southeastasiahttp://tudiabetes.com/group/caribbeanhttp://tudiabetes.com/group/diabeticsinchinataiwanorjapanhttp://tudiabetes.com/group/africanswithdiabeteshttp://tudiabetes.com/group/diabeticsfrommiddleeast. The big problem is getting a suitable world map to use. The CIA World Factbook has a map but it's too detailed.Does anyone else have suggestions for a suitable one?. Manny I think you and I are the only geeks here.Do you want the source code for the US map part?If you can get me a decent world map I can quickly put the other one together.Happy WDDBernard. I have been trying to find a good world map.Is there anything more besides the source code that is visible through \"View Source\" that I would need?\n",
      "I have a HTC Touch Pro which is has windows mobile installed. I have noticed a lot of diabetes management programs for Iphone and Palm but not Windows Mobile. Does anyone here use Windows Mobile based programs?Thanks!. There's not too much out there for WinMob or BlackBerry right now. Since I work for AT&T and get all the new toys (yeah right) I've been trying to find one that works on WinMob. I've seen some good diet programs but nothing that really works well.I'm convinced that making a web based mgmt program (like Sugar Stats) but more social networking oriented (integration with Ning Twitter Jaiku laconica etc) would be the way to go first then make custom front ends for Windows Mobile. Live Mesh looks promising as a way to do this! I want to make my software Open Source so anyone can take and make it their own. I just don't like the way SugarStats.com charges for food/exer tracking so I'm going to make my own that anyone can install on a server.For now though I just use Excel Mobile to track times and events (food meds exercise stress sleep etc.). I currently use Co-pilot from Abbot to monitor my blood sugar I just checked under add / remove programs on my desktop and it uses only 24 meg - maybe possibly installing it on my 16g micro sd card? or will windows mobile not recognize it?. Hi !You could try SiDiary application. It works on PC and on several mobile devices including PocketPCs. Version 5 for PC looks little weird but version 6 looks much better... Try it out http://www.sidiary.org/ it has support for many meters and also some pumps...Andy. Mhm. If your application is for PC it won't work on Windows Mobile you would need special version of your software to be able to run it on Mobiles... It is totally different architecture.... For each mobile (PocketPC Palm) you need different version.Andy. I guess now I need to see if SI Diary is going to work with my 722 pump. Mhm. I think not... They have two pumps supported (I think): Deltec and Roche/Tron... Minimed is beeing very uncooperative....I am developing one other diabetes management software GGC which is open source (http://ggc.sourceforge.net) and I had trouble getting any help from them (or most of other companies producing diabetes hardware: meters pumps cgms) so only way is to reverse ingeneer connections with devices but it's long and painful process and you have to have devices to do this... You can try it out but it works just on PCs (almost any of them) I am working on application that will also work on PocketPC but it will be just simple thing which will be used when you don't have \"real\" version handy...Andy. do you just need access to the program that was distributed with the pump and meter? I know you can download them online.. Nope... Software you download can just use data they get from devices but I have no access to that data from my software. What I need is protocol (e.g. language with which device can communicate with PC) this is all that any developer needs to add support for some device in his/hers software. Most of companies keep this data for themselves which makes sense if you have devices which are not used by a lot of people... but in case of medical devices used by a lot of people this should be open so that devices could be used by more software/more poeple.You probably ask what would be idea be of more software if you already have 1 that works... It's all about manipulation of data for example some application can do what others can't... We are usually limited with applications that support devices we have and in most cases we are \"forced\" to use some software so that we can get and see the data but most of this applications are not so good they are made by people who don't have diabetes and therefore don't understand what we need... GGC and SiDiary are both made by diabetics and therefore support a lot of stuff others doesn't...In some cases we add support by \"spying\" on communication between PC and device and then using that information sometimes applications help us by creating export files which we can import (I will do this with GGC and Minimed pumps when I add support for it) or sometime we can connect to original software or at least with database in it...Andy. I have the minimed software and the copilot software that was from Abbot would those help you in any way?as linux user I prefer open source anyway! I am forced to use windows for my diabetes purposes though . No. When using 1st method... spying you have to have original software and device and then you do commands in software (forexample get pump data) and you listen with special software to se what PC is saying to device and what device respond with. It would be possible for you to do this for me and send me this report but in most cases this is not enough... you have tohave a real device to test on it... If everything goes right I will have pump by february (loaned for now) and I will do some support for Minimed then only problem is that base framework for pumps is still not finished so it will take time...As for Abbot I will get some meter devices from my friend and then I will try to add support for it to GGC but then again it will take time... New version 0.4 is comming out in January without support for your devices... I am mostly working alone on this project (eventhough its open source) so it takes time...Andy. I have a HTC phone I use Diabetes Pilot http://www.diabetespilot.com/ Its a pretty basic software but for me it does the jobregards. I want to see some software like this integrate with Microsoft HealthVault (http://healthvault.com). I love using these other sites to track sugars and print reports but I don't like having just daily totals for food intake and not having meds logged when I take them (today I missed a Byetta shot and my sugar shot up after eating.. HiI collaborate with others working on a cell phone application for people with diabetes whereby sugar readings can be sent to their healthcare team and feedback sent back to their cell phone. Simply it works by using almost all types of cell phones after taking the reading from the meter the sugar level is entered into the cell phone and to keep costs low a minimum amount of data is transmitted. To maintain privacy no personally identifiable information is transmitted only the sugar level ID# and date and time stamp. A pilot project was conducted using this system at one of Canada's largest diabetes centers. It showed how 20 people enrolled in the pilot achieved a reduction in HA1c for 18 people and maintained a good level for one person.Im very interested in how to provide this system to the members of this group. To achieve this I believe in addition to TuDiabetes.com and from my research on using social networks a new group may need to be formed with upgraded features such as an option to select a protocol to keep the data private add a rigorous learning process on symptoms and treatments and a method to engage healthcare teams in the process. It is my wish is provide this service free for people with diabetes (except for the additional data communication charges on their cell phone.) One way Im looking to fund is this through online data collection revenues where people from this group have the option to take market research surveys.My first question is do you believe there would be an interest from this group and others? Why or Why not? Please be a specific as possible.Thank you so much for your time and Im looking forward to your thoughts!Steve. I hear you im a blackberry user as well. I was thinking of writing my own web app like sugarstats but free  All the data seems to be out there you can DL the USDA DB there are exercise databases out there lots of free plotting stuff on SF... Id be interested in hearing more abut your progress and being part of the dev team if you go that route . Hi !Do you have any links for excercise databases? We will be adding activity manager to our application (GGC) and are currently looking for places to find such things...Andy\n"
